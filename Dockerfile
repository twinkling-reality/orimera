# The default image serves the API, migrates, and runs the pose worker. Compose builds the
# derivative worker from the same source with the depth extra instead, keeping torch and pycolmap
# out of one process while retaining one reviewed recipe.
#
# There is no ENTRYPOINT, only a CMD. An entrypoint would make the migration one-shot and make
# the ingest job reach for `--entrypoint`, and the whole point of one image is that they do not.
#
# WHAT THE DEFAULT CONTAINS is the small CPU pose extra. The derivative-worker build argument
# selects the torch depth extra. Every citation still resolves to original bytes because
# reconstruction is never evidence.
