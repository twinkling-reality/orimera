# Exulanica documentation

Exulanica is a Personal World Memory Model. It turns a personal photograph library into separate
navigable 3D memory regions inside one continuous first-person browser space called the Atlas,
connects recurring people, places, objects and events across those regions, and lets a person
explore and query their own lived history under one rule: every historical factual claim resolves to
the exact original source it came from. Claims resolve to captured bytes, never to derived geometry,
so reconstruction quality never participates in the truth guarantee. The system may organize on a
guess and may never assert on one, which is why an automatically proposed identity link can shape the
Atlas but cannot support a factual statement until the account holder confirms it.

The corpus is photographs and carries no audio, so the recurring voices and conversations described
in the original concept are deferred with a stated reason rather than claimed. The evidence and the
reasoning are in [product-specification.md](product-specification.md) section 2.

## Start here

**Evaluating the project.** [product-specification.md](product-specification.md) sections 1 to 4 for
what the product is and what the demonstration shows, then section 11 for the known limitations,
and then [runtime-verification.md](runtime-verification.md) for what the platform actually did when
it was called.

**Running or extending it.** [architecture-overview.md](architecture-overview.md) sections 1 to 3 for
system shape, the platform split and the deployment topology; then
[model-and-service-selection.md](model-and-service-selection.md) section 2 for the exact model
identifiers, their fallbacks and the routing rules; then
[domain-and-evidence-model.md](domain-and-evidence-model.md) sections 1 and 4 for the evidence
address and the schema the migration creates. Read
[runtime-verification.md](runtime-verification.md) before writing client code: it records the
platform behaviours that will otherwise cause silent bugs, including the reasoning-token floor on
every call and the one structured-output mechanism that is actually honoured.

**Reviewing the technology choices.** The [decision records](#decision-records) in number order, then
[model-and-service-selection.md](model-and-service-selection.md) for the model and service matrix,
[license-matrix.md](license-matrix.md) for ship and do-not-ship verdicts per component, and
[runtime-verification.md](runtime-verification.md) for the measurements that settled the open
questions in both.

### Decision records

`adr/` holds the decisions that were expensive enough to be worth recording with their alternatives
and their consequences, so that a later reader can tell a considered choice from an inherited default.

| Record | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [adr/0002-model-routing.md](adr/0002-model-routing.md) | NVIDIA text Nemotron as the reasoning core, with a non-NVIDIA vision sensor | ACCEPTED |
| [adr/0003-renderer-selection.md](adr/0003-renderer-selection.md) | Renderer bake-off, resolved on matched-resolution measurement. PlayCanvas wins on 1% low frame pacing and covers both reconstruction rungs natively | ACCEPTED: PlayCanvas |
| [adr/0004-exif-orientation-normalisation.md](adr/0004-exif-orientation-normalisation.md) | Normalise EXIF orientation once at ingest so every downstream stage works from upright pixels, and record that the transform happened | ACCEPTED |
| [adr/0005-unified-selection-model.md](adr/0005-unified-selection-model.md) | One Selection primitive across person, object, place, time and trip, reached from four equal entry points | ACCEPTED |
| [adr/0006-desktop-viewport-boundary.md](adr/0006-desktop-viewport-boundary.md) | Desktop/laptop-only Atlas with an explicit 60rem viewport boundary | ACCEPTED |
| [adr/0007-world-composition-and-customization.md](adr/0007-world-composition-and-customization.md) | Passive module/recipe catalogs, deterministic composition, stable provenance-bearing topology, and protected customization transactions | ACCEPTED; appearance backend implemented, structural editing open |
| [adr/0008-generated-geometry.md](adr/0008-generated-geometry.md) | Generatively completed geometry is refused from the reconstruction ladder, with the checklist that a later admission would have to satisfy | ACCEPTED: refused, with a stated path |
| [adr/0009-the-ladder-above-rung-3.md](adr/0009-the-ladder-above-rung-3.md) | A layered gate composes receipts into rungs 1 and 2, rung 2 no longer requires a splat, a model-derived scale never opens the query path, and a posed multi-view set is a rung 3 sub-state | ACCEPTED; production rung 3 implemented, rung 2 and rung 1 producers blocked on real measurements and compute |
| [adr/0010-opm-2.md](adr/0010-opm-2.md) | The point-map container evolves to version 2 with an authoritative section list, a 4-byte tags section, a declared alpha meaning, and placement kept outside the file | ACCEPTED and implemented |

## Current state

A real call to `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` on Nebius Token Factory returned HTTP 200 with the
model identifier echoed in the response body, and a real Tavily search returned HTTP 200 with its
request payload retained as evidence of data minimisation. Both were executed on 2026-08-27 and are
recorded in [runtime-verification.md](runtime-verification.md), which overrides every other document
on conflict.

The evidence spine is implemented rather than only specified: migration
`exulanica/migrations/0001_spine.sql` and the `exulanica/evidence/` modules, with tests. Building it
found errors in the committed design, and those are corrected in place and marked **CORRECTED**
rather than left for the next reader to trip over. The suite is 588 tests, 227 of which require a
live PostgreSQL instance and skip without one. All 588 pass against the documented target,
PostgreSQL 18 with pgvector, with nothing substituted for either, so the SQL-level guarantees are
executed rather than described. The SQLite mirror the ingest path used to write is deleted:
there is one schema.

The browser renderer is decided: PlayCanvas Engine 2.21.4, on matched-resolution measurement
([adr/0003-renderer-selection.md](adr/0003-renderer-selection.md)).

## Conventions

Every claim in this documentation set carries exactly one epistemic status, and the status is part of
the claim:

- **VERIFIED** cites a primary source URL and the date it was retrieved, or, where the fact is about
  runtime behaviour, the execution that produced it.
- **DECISION** records a choice together with the alternative that was rejected and why.
- **ASSUMPTION** is unvalidated, and names the experiment that would settle it.
- **OPEN** is unresolved, and says what would resolve it.
- **CORRECTED** marks a claim rewritten against what was actually built, naming the artefact and the
  test that forced the correction.

Two rules govern how those statuses are assigned:

- Every consequential technical claim cites a primary source with a retrieval date.
- **Agreement between sources is not evidence.** Two summaries repeating an unverified claim leave it
  unverified, and it is marked as unverified until a primary source or an execution settles it.

Some documents reference stored artifacts that are not in this repository, such as archived API
responses. Those hold account-identifying response headers and, in places, personal media, so they
are deliberately not committed; where a field in one of them matters, the document quotes it.
