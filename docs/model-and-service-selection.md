# Model and service selection

Status: mixed. Every claim below carries exactly one label. Retrieval date for all VERIFIED claims is
**2026-08-27**.

Label key, matching `docs/README.md`:
**VERIFIED** (primary source URL plus retrieval date) / **DECISION** (records the rejected
alternative) / **ASSUMPTION** (names the experiment that settles it) / **OPEN** (unresolved).

Scope note, because it changes what appears here. The corpus is a personal **photograph** library.
There is no video and no audio. Nebius Token Factory has zero audio capability, so the "recurring
voices" and "conversations" pillars have neither a platform path nor source material and are deferred
with an honest explanation rather than claimed. See section 8.

One thing to hold onto while reading section 2: **"verified" means the exact identifier string was
read from a primary source on 2026-08-27. It does not by itself mean the model has been invoked.**
One identifier, `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning`, has been called for real and its response archived;
the rest are catalog-verified only. Catalog presence is not runtime behaviour. Where a claim rests on
execution, [runtime-verification.md](runtime-verification.md) is the source and it overrides this
document on conflict. Section 7 sets out what may and may not be said as a result.

---

## 1. The platform split

Three execution surfaces. Each boundary is placed by a property the other two surfaces do not have,
not by convenience.

| Surface | Billing | What runs there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Nebius Token Factory** | per token, serverless | Reasoning core (text Nemotron), vision sensor over photographs, text embeddings, optional rerank |
| **Nebius AI Cloud** | per GPU hour and per vCPU/GiB hour | Camera pose and splat training jobs, API process, PostgreSQL, object storage, local-class perception models that need a GPU |
| **Browser** | free | Splat and 2.5D rendering, camera, DOM overlay UI and the accessibility surface, evidence playback |

### 1.1 Why inference sits on Token Factory

**VERIFIED.** Token Factory is a single global OpenAI-compatible endpoint at
`https://api.tokenfactory.nebius.com/v1/`, Bearer auth, usable through the stock `openai` SDK with
`base_url` overridden. Source: https://docs.tokenfactory.nebius.com/api-reference/introduction

**DECISION.** All LLM and VLM inference goes to Token Factory serverless, never to a self-hosted
model server. Rejected alternative: self-host the vision and reasoning models on Nebius AI Cloud.
Rejected on arithmetic, not preference. A full inference pass over the corpus costs roughly **$0.41**
(section 5.3). One `gpu-l40s-a` `1gpu-8vcpu-32gb` instance in eu-north1 costs
`1.35 + (8 x 0.012) + (32 x 0.0032) = $1.548/hr` on demand, so a single idle GPU exceeds the entire
projected inference bill of the project in under twenty minutes.
Source: https://docs.nebius.com/compute/resources/pricing

**DECISION.** Use only the global base URL. Never hardcode a regional Token Factory host.
**VERIFIED** rationale: Token Factory public endpoints report Region "Global", Nebius warns the
processing location "can change at any time, without notice", and that a regional base URL "can stop
working if the endpoint's processing region changes".
Source: https://docs.tokenfactory.nebius.com/ai-models-inference/overview
Consequence: the per-model `regions` strings in section 2 are informational for latency reasoning.
They are not addressable and nothing in the code may branch on them.

### 1.2 Why reconstruction, the database and the API sit on AI Cloud

**VERIFIED.** Token Factory has no raw GPU VM and no arbitrary container. Its only custom-weights
path is Dedicated Endpoints, "currently in beta and available on request", covering supported LLM
architectures. Source: Token Factory docs, dedicated-endpoints/custom-weights

COLMAP and gsplat are neither an LLM nor an API-shaped workload, so they cannot run on Token Factory
at all. They run as Nebius Serverless AI Jobs, which take the same `--platform` and `--preset` values
as Compute VMs including `--preemptible`, are billed per second, and self-terminate.
**VERIFIED**, source: https://docs.nebius.com/serverless/jobs/manage

**DECISION.** Pin every GPU workload to **eu-north1**. **VERIFIED** reason: eu-north1 is the only
region with a non-zero default L40S quota (L40S = 2, H100 = 32, H200 = 32). us-central1 has no GPU
type with a non-zero default at all, and the custom-image quota is 0 in every region, so the pipeline
ships as containers and never as a baked image.
Source: https://docs.nebius.com/compute/resources/quotas-limits

**DECISION.** The API process and PostgreSQL run on a plain `cpu-d3` Compute VM with a restart policy
and a Network SSD volume. Rejected alternative: put both on Nebius Serverless AI endpoints, which
scores marginally better against the track's Serverless Endpoints guidance. Rejected because
Serverless AI is **VERIFIED** as Preview with "no Service Level provided for the Service" and "does
not provide automatic retry, recovery, or redundancy mechanisms", endpoint lifetime is documented as
"hours to days", and the demo must survive unattended from 2026-10-30 to at least 2026-12-15.
Serverless AI applies Compute pricing, so the cost is identical either way and the reliability is not.
Sources: https://docs.nebius.com/legal/specific-terms/serverless-ai ,
https://docs.nebius.com/serverless/overview , https://docs.nebius.com/serverless/pricing-quotas
Jobs are retained precisely because a failed job is retryable and a failed database is not.

**DECISION.** Not Nebius Managed PostgreSQL. **VERIFIED** cost: the documented `4vcpu-16gb` example
is $0.28/hr, about $204/month, for a database that will not reach 1 GB.
Source: https://docs.nebius.com/postgresql/resources/pricing

### 1.3 Why the browser gets rendering and nothing else

**DECISION.** The browser renders and navigates. It holds no credential, calls no model provider, and
constructs no external query. Every live-web lookup is server-constructed and opt-in. Two reasons,
one performance and one security:

- Rendering is a per-frame budget. A splat scene at 60 fps cannot round-trip anything to a server, so
  the frame loop must be entirely local. The scene budget is capped by **measured frame time**, never
  by device sniffing, so no guessed hardware number is ever load-bearing.
- The browser is the untrusted surface. Query construction is exactly where an injected instruction
  would try to act, so it stays server side.

**DECISION.** No model inference runs in the browser. There is no browser-side model in the plan and
none is needed: every inference in this system is either a Token Factory call or an offline job.

**VERIFIED.** Canvas content is invisible to screen readers, so the DOM overlay is the accessibility
surface and must carry real focusable labelled elements for every entity, evidence item and source
moment.

**OPEN.** Renderer choice. `browser-rendering` recommends PlayCanvas Engine 2.21.x;
`interaction-architecture` designed the entire Companion, Atlas and overlay system against
three.js / react-three-fiber. The research recorded this as genuinely unresolved and did not pick a
winner on evidence. Settled by a bake-off (experiment X-R1) by the end of week 3. Not a model
selection question, recorded here only because it sits on this boundary.

## 2. Model and service matrix

**Verified column semantics.** "Catalog" means the exact identifier string was read from
`https://tokenfactory.nebius.com/api/public/models_info` on 2026-08-27, which Nebius states verbatim
is "the authoritative machine-readable source". "Card" means the model card was read at its primary
URL. **Neither means the model has been invoked.** Region is informational only (section 1.1).

### 2.1 Nebius Token Factory, per token

| Role | Model, exact identifier | Price in / out per M tokens | Context | Region | License (catalog) | Verified | Declared fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reasoning core, Companion dialogue, cross-scene continuity, NVIDIA compliance | `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` | $0.06 / $0.24 | 1024K | eu-north1 | OpenMDW v1.1 | catalog | `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B` |
| Escalation tier, only on measured Lightning failure | `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` | $0.30 / $0.90 | 256K | us-central1 | nvidia-open-model-license | catalog | `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` (degrade, do not fail) |
| Reasoning fallback, identical price and role | `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B` | $0.06 / $0.24 | 262K | eu-north1 | nvidia-open-model-license | catalog | `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` |
| Manual escalation ceiling, not routed to by default | `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Ultra-550b-a55b` | $1.00 / $3.00 | 1024K | us-central1 | openmdw-1.1 | catalog | n/a, not in the default route |
| Vision sensor over photographs | `openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5` | $0.658 / $1.11 | **32K** | eu-north1 | Apache 2.0 | catalog | `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` |
| Vision sensor fallback, and Nebius' own recommended replacement for the removed NVIDIA vision models | `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` | $0.30 / $1.20 | 1049K | us-central1 | "MiniMax-M3", **unverified** | catalog | `openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5` |
| Structured extraction, only if Nemotron schema conformance fails | `Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507` | $0.20 / $0.60 | 262K | eu-north1 | Apache 2.0 | catalog | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731` |
| Text embeddings | `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B` | $0.01 / $0.00 | 41K | eu-north1 | Apache 2.0 | catalog | **none on Token Factory, see 2.4** |
| Reranking | `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B` on `POST /v1/rerank` | $0.01 / $0.00 | 41K | eu-north1 | Apache 2.0 | **no**, endpoint verified, model compatibility unverified | RRF over a tsvector arm and a vector arm computed in SQL |

**VERIFIED, and this is the trap that costs an afternoon.** The catalog's human-readable `name` field
differs from the callable `model_id`. Casing and separators are inconsistent across the Nemotron
line: `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B` doubles the vendor prefix,
`nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` is entirely lowercase, `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` uses an
underscore where the display name uses a dot. **Code reads `flavors[].model_id`, never `name`.** A
typo is a silent 404-class failure. Source: https://tokenfactory.nebius.com/api/public/models_info

**VERIFIED.** Catalog license strings disagree with HuggingFace card frontmatter, consistently in the
stricter direction: the catalog labels `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B` and
`nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` as `nvidia-open-model-license` (revocable, guardrail-conditioned,
unilaterally amendable) where the HuggingFace frontmatter reads `nvidia-nemotron-open-model-license`
(irrevocable, no guardrail clause, no unilateral amendment). These are genuinely different documents.
**DECISION.** `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` records the license read from raw HuggingFace YAML
frontmatter at a pinned revision SHA, never the Nebius catalog string and never the family name.

### 2.2 Nebius AI Cloud, per GPU hour

| Role | Component | Shape and price | Region | Verified | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Camera poses | COLMAP 4.x sparse pipeline, CPU-only path | Serverless Job, or local | eu-north1 | card, CPU path confirmed | `facebook/map-anything-apache` as automatic rescue |
| Splat training | `nerfstudio-project/gsplat`, MCMC, 1M cap | `gpu-l40s-a` `1gpu-8vcpu-32gb`, $1.548/hr on demand, $0.749/hr preemptible, `--preemptible` | eu-north1 | card | Brush on Metal locally (Apache-2.0) |
| Monocular metric depth, the 2.5D rung | `Ruicheng/moge-2-vitl` | local M3 Pro, MIT | n/a | card, MIT confirmed | `Ruicheng/moge-3-vitl` on the Nebius Linux GPU (MoGe-3 has no macOS path) |
| Segmentation for people-masking before reconstruction | `facebook/sam2.1-hiera-tiny` | AI Cloud GPU | eu-north1 | card, Apache-2.0 confirmed | none. **Never SAM 3** |
| Open-vocabulary detection | `IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-tiny` via transformers | AI Cloud GPU, MPS locally | eu-north1 | card | `google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble` |
| Appearance vector | `facebook/dinov2-base` | GPU or MPS | eu-north1 | card | CLIP (MIT) |
| API and PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL 18.6 + pgvector >= 0.8.6, `halfvec(4096)`, exact search (CORRECTED, see runtime-verification.md section 7) | `cpu-d3 2vcpu-8gb` Compute VM, Network SSD | eu-north1 | versions | none. Do **not** use Managed PostgreSQL |
| Object storage | Nebius Object Storage, `https://storage.eu-north1.nebius.cloud` | Intelligent class, versioned at bucket creation | eu-north1 | docs | none |

**VERIFIED.** Nebius Object Storage does not support Object Lock or Legal Hold: "Write-once-read-many
(WORM) retention policies are not supported." **DECISION.** Say "append-only by policy" in product
copy, never "immutable", "WORM" or "tamper-proof".
Source: https://docs.nebius.com/object-storage/interfaces/s3-api-compatibility

### 2.3 Local CPU, no hosting cost

| Role | Model | License status | Verified | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Face detection | `opencv_zoo/models/face_detection_yunet` (`2026may` ONNX) | LICENSE read | yes | none needed |
| Face alignment | `shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks.dat` | permissive | yes | none. **Never the 68-point model** |
| Face embeddings | `opencv_zoo/models/face_recognition_sface` ONNX | LICENSE read | yes | `dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1` |
| Splat compression | `@playcanvas/splat-transform` v3.3.3 | MIT | yes | none |

**DECISION.** Never vendor weights. One `models.manifest.json` carries repo id plus revision SHA plus
the license read from raw HuggingFace frontmatter, and CI re-fetches each pinned revision's license
and fails on drift. The repository is Apache-2.0 and the five most likely accidental violations are
all silent transitive ones: `pip install insightface` pulling buffalo_l, linking the INRIA
`diff-gaussian-rasterization` kernel, the 68-point dlib predictor, Ultralytics arriving through a
tracking library, and an unpinned NVIDIA tag where v1 is CC-BY-NC and v2.1 is not.

### 2.4 The embedding role has no same-tier fallback

**VERIFIED.** The Token Factory catalog contains exactly one model of type `embedding`:
`Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`. Counted across all 30 entries in
`https://tokenfactory.nebius.com/api/public/models_info`, retrieved 2026-08-27.

**Consequence, stated plainly because it is a hole in the mitigation in section 6.** Every other role
has a declared fallback that is another Token Factory identifier and can therefore be swapped at
runtime. The embedding role does not. Its declared fallback, `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Embed-1B-BF16`
(OpenMDW-1.1, 2048-dim), is a self-hosted deployment, which is a build-time change and not a runtime
failover.

**OPEN.** Whether to pre-build the self-hosted embedding path as a warm standby, accept a
single-point dependency for the judging window, or precompute and freeze all embeddings before
submission so the demo never calls the embedding endpoint at all. The third option is the cheapest
and probably correct, but it has not been designed and it interacts with whether new captures can be
ingested during judging.

### 2.5 Non-model services

| Role | Service | Terms | Verified | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public-entity lookup | Tavily Search API | free tier 1,000 credits/month, resets on the 1st, pay-as-you-go $0.008/credit | https://www.tavily.com/pricing | **cut the feature.** A leaky gate is worse than no feature |
| SPA hosting | Vercel Hobby, static | $0 | yes | Cloudflare Workers Static Assets |
| Edge cache, optional | Cloudflare proxy in front of the Nebius origin | n/a | yes | none, the Nebius origin serves directly |

**DECISION.** The asset origin stays on Nebius Object Storage. Rejected alternative: Cloudflare R2,
whose free egress would save roughly $2 to $10 across the project. Rejected because keeping the origin
on Nebius keeps the platform-compliance sentence literally true, which is worth more than $10 under an
equally-weighted Technological Implementation criterion. A Cloudflare cache in front of the Nebius
origin is fine and is recommended for judges outside Europe.

**VERIFIED.** Tavily "may use portions of query data to improve future responses" and shares query
data with third-party search index providers where its own index cannot retrieve content, advising
users to avoid personal information in queries. Source: https://www.tavily.com/privacy
**DECISION.** Tavily queries are server-constructed, opt-in, and never carry personal content from
the corpus.

## 3. The 2026-08-31 deprecation

**VERIFIED.** On 2026-08-31, from Token Factory **Serverless only** (Dedicated Endpoints unaffected),
Nebius removes ten models. Verbatim from the notice, with Nebius' own recommended replacement:

| Removed 2026-08-31 | Nebius' recommended replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni` | `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` |
| `nvidia/Cosmos3-Super-Reasoner` | `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` |
| `nvidia/Llama-3_1-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-v1` | `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` |
| `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct` | `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` |
| `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` | `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` |
| `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5` | `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` |
| `NousResearch/Hermes-4-70B` | `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` | `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking` | `Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B` |
| `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash` | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731` |

Source: https://docs.tokenfactory.nebius.com/august-2026-deprecation-notice (retrieved 2026-08-27)

**VERIFIED.** The two NVIDIA models removed, `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni` and
`nvidia/Cosmos3-Super-Reasoner`, are the only two NVIDIA models in the catalog that declare an
`image` use case. **After 2026-08-31 there is no NVIDIA vision or multimodal model on Token Factory
Serverless.** Nebius' own recommended replacement for both is the non-NVIDIA `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3`,
which is Nebius stating the same conclusion in its own words.

**Nothing in section 2 depends on a removed model.** Every Token Factory identifier in the matrix,
primary and fallback alike, survives 2026-08-31. This is a design constraint that was applied before
the matrix was written, not a coincidence, and it is why the reasoning core is a text Nemotron and
the vision sensor is not NVIDIA. The rejected alternatives are recorded in `adr/0002-model-routing.md`.

**VERIFIED, second round, for cadence.** Nebius removed 11 models on 2026-06-22: `-fast` flavors of
DeepSeek V3.2, MiniMax M2.5, Kimi K2.5, gpt-oss-120b, Qwen3 Thinking and Qwen3.5, plus
`PrimeIntellect/INTELLECT-3` and `zai-org/GLM-5`.
Source: https://docs.tokenfactory.nebius.com/june-2026-deprecation-notice

**VERIFIED.** The entire `-fast` flavor family was killed in June, yet the inference overview page
still documents it as a live feature ("To use the Fast flavor, append `-fast` to the model name") and
zero `-fast` identifiers remain in the live catalog. Related staleness: the vision-capabilities
examples page still shows `Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct` and `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct`,
neither of which exists in the catalog.
**DECISION.** Treat only `models_info` and `openapi.json` as authoritative. Never copy a model
identifier out of a documentation example.

---

## 4. The catalog `type` field is unreliable. OPEN.

**VERIFIED, from the primary catalog JSON.** The catalog carries both a coarse `type` field and a
`use_cases` array, and they disagree. Four models typed `text2text` declare `image` in `use_cases`,
and one of those also declares `video`:

| Model | `type` | `use_cases` includes | Survives 2026-08-31 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni` | `text2text` | `image` | no |
| `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` | `text2text` | `image`, `video` | yes |
| `google/gemma-3-27b-it` | `text2text` | `image` | yes |
| `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.7-Code` | `text2text` | `image` | yes |

Source: https://tokenfactory.nebius.com/api/public/models_info (retrieved 2026-08-27)

The Nano Omni case is the clearest evidence that `type` is a coarse label rather than a capability
statement. Its own catalog `description` reads "The most open, efficient, and accurate omni-modal
reasoning model for agentic AI" and its `huggingface_url` points at
`nvidia/Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni-30B-A3B-Reasoning-FP8`, whose card documents video, audio, image and
text input. It is typed `text2text` anyway.

**VERIFIED.** The API schema is model-agnostic. `ChatCompletionMessage.content` is a discriminated
union of exactly three part types (`text`, `image_url`, `video_url`), so the request will validate
against any model. Capability is a per-model property, and `use_cases` is the only per-model
capability signal the catalog publishes. Source: https://api.tokenfactory.nebius.com/openapi.json

**VERIFIED.** `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` is the only model in the entire catalog declaring the `video`
use case.

**OPEN.** `use_cases` **appears** to be authoritative and `type` **appears** to be a coarse
categorisation, but this is inference from a field-level disagreement, not a documented contract.
Nebius does not document the relationship between the two fields. Two streams reading the same JSON
and reaching the same conclusion is agreement, not evidence.

**The experiment that settles it, and it is one call.** Send a single `image_url` content part to
`MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` (typed `text2text`, declares `image`) and record the response. A 200 with a
coherent description of the image settles it in favour of `use_cases`. A 4xx rejecting the content
part settles it in favour of `type`, and invalidates the vision-sensor fallback in section 2.1.
Repeat once against `openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5` (typed `image2text`) as the control. Fifteen minutes,
blocked only on credentials.

**DECISION, pending that call.** Code selects models by reading `use_cases`, and the build-time
preflight (section 6) asserts on `use_cases` rather than on `type`. The primary vision sensor
`openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5` is typed `image2text` **and** declares `image`, so both readings agree on it
and the primary path does not depend on resolving this. Only the declared fallback does.

---

## 5. Routing and cost discipline

### 5.1 The routing table

| Traffic | Model | Why this tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Every Companion dialogue turn | `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` | 3B active parameters, validated to 1M context, card describes it as built for "long-running autonomous agents, sub-agent workhorse deployments". Cheapest tier in the NVIDIA line and the largest context in it |
| Every cross-scene continuity decision over an evidence packet | `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` | Context length, not parameter count, is the binding constraint. The packet is many scenes, many entity records, many evidence spans. 1024K context at $0.06/M input is the correct shape for a long, shallow reasoning task |
| One structured-extraction pass per photograph, at ingest only | `openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5` | Runs once per photograph, never per dialogue turn. Carries the catalog's "JSON mode" tag, which no surviving text Nemotron does (section 5.4) |
| Continuity decisions **only** where Lightning is measured to fail | `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` | 12B active against 3B, bought only where wrong answers are most expensive, and only after a measurement says Lightning is the reason |
| Nothing, by default | `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Ultra-550b-a55b` | See 5.2 |

**DECISION.** One model serves both dialogue and continuity reasoning. Rejected alternative: a
separate heavier model for continuity, which is what the raw research recommended before the
Lightning context window was weighed against it. Collapsing both onto Lightning removes an entire
model from the routing surface, and the escalation path to Super remains available the moment a
measurement justifies it.

**ASSUMPTION.** That Lightning is sufficient for cross-scene continuity resolution. Nobody measured
it. Validation: run the continuity task on Lightning and on Super over the same evidence packets and
compare against user-confirmed ground truth. If Lightning holds, the system stays at one text model.

### 5.2 Why the default route is not Ultra, with the arithmetic

The track guidance says "Reach for Nemotron 3 Ultra when you need serious reasoning, and let Nano or
Super handle the fast, everyday calls". This section is the honest answer to why the routing table
does not do that.

**ASSUMPTION**, and every number below inherits it: a representative turn is **8,000 input tokens and
800 output tokens**. The input is long because each turn carries an evidence packet plus prior entity
state. Validation: read `usage.prompt_tokens` and `usage.completion_tokens` from twenty real turns
and replace the assumption with a measured distribution. Fifteen minutes once credentials exist.

Prices are **VERIFIED** per million tokens from the catalog JSON, retrieved 2026-08-27.

| Model | in / out per M | 8,000 input | 800 output | **Per turn** | 300 turns | Relative to Lightning |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` | $0.06 / $0.24 | $0.000480 | $0.000192 | **$0.000672** | $0.2016 | 1.00x |
| `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B` | $0.06 / $0.24 | $0.000480 | $0.000192 | **$0.000672** | $0.2016 | 1.00x |
| `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` | $0.30 / $0.90 | $0.002400 | $0.000720 | **$0.003120** | $0.9360 | 4.64x |
| `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Ultra-550b-a55b` | $1.00 / $3.00 | $0.008000 | $0.002400 | **$0.010400** | $3.1200 | **15.48x** |

Routing an identical turn to Ultra instead of Lightning costs **15.48 times as much**. Against the
roughly $50 of Token Factory credits the project expects, that is about **74,400 Lightning turns
versus about 4,800 Ultra turns**. The absolute amounts are small either way, which is exactly why the
discipline has to be an argument rather than a budget: nothing stops the project routing to Ultra
except the absence of a reason.

**DECISION.** Ultra stays in the manifest as an available escalation and is not in any default route.
It is used only when a measurement shows Lightning and Super both failing a specific task, and the
measurement is recorded next to the routing change. Rejected alternative: default to Ultra for
"serious reasoning" as the track guidance suggests. Rejected because Ultra's advantage over Lightning
on this project's tasks has never been measured, and paying 15.48x for an unmeasured advantage is the
kind of claim the project has committed not to make. Note that the routing table also gives Ultra
nothing it is uniquely good at: Lightning already carries the same 1024K context.

### 5.3 Full-corpus pass cost

**ASSUMPTION.** 150 photographs, roughly 1,500 input tokens and 300 output tokens per image, plus 300
text reasoning calls at the 8,000 / 800 shape, plus roughly 1M tokens embedded. The per-image token
figure is the single number the entire vision cost model rests on and it has never been measured.
Validation: one real call, read `usage.prompt_tokens`, then repeat at 2, 4 and 8 images to separate
the per-image slope from the fixed overhead.

| Stage | Model | Arithmetic | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Vision, 225,000 in / 45,000 out | `openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5` | 0.225 x $0.658 + 0.045 x $1.11 | $0.198 |
| Vision alternative | `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` | 0.225 x $0.30 + 0.045 x $1.20 | $0.122 |
| Text reasoning, 2.4M in / 0.24M out | `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` | 2.4 x $0.06 + 0.24 x $0.24 | $0.202 |
| Embeddings, 1M tokens | `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B` | 1.0 x $0.01 | $0.010 |
| **Complete pass** | | | **$0.41** |

At twenty times that for development iteration, retries and prompt tuning, total Token Factory spend
across the project is roughly **$10 to $25**. Inference is not where this project's money goes. GPU
time for reconstruction and continuous hosting are, and the single largest cost risk is a forgotten
GPU VM at $1.548/hr, because quotas count stopped VMs and volumes bill whether attached or not.

### 5.4 Structured output is the routing risk, not cost

**VERIFIED.** Only `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash`, `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731`,
`nvidia/Cosmos3-Super-Reasoner` and `openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5` carry the catalog's "JSON mode" tag.
**No surviving text Nemotron carries it.** Separately, the live OpenAPI spec's own `response_format`
description states "Only {'type': 'json_object'} or {'type': 'text' } is supported", which
contradicts the documentation page describing `json_schema` support.
Sources: https://tokenfactory.nebius.com/api/public/models_info ,
https://api.tokenfactory.nebius.com/openapi.json , https://docs.tokenfactory.nebius.com/ai-models-inference/json

**ASSUMPTION.** That `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` honours `response_format: json_schema` reliably
enough to emit schema-valid structured answers. Validation: 20 identical nested-schema requests with
`strict: true`, then the same 20 through `extra_body.guided_json`, measuring conformance rate. Two
hours. If it fails, the declared fallback for structured extraction is
`Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507`, which is Apache-2.0 and carries the JSON mode tag, and the
reasoning core keeps the NVIDIA compliance role while giving up the extraction role.

Noting the shape of that failure honestly: it would not break NVIDIA compliance, but it would mean
the NVIDIA model produces prose that a second model structures, which is a weaker story than the one
in section 7.

## 6. Deprecation during the judging window

**VERIFIED.** Two deprecation rounds in roughly ten weeks: 11 models removed 2026-06-22, 10 more
2026-08-31. **VERIFIED.** The demo must run unattended from 2026-10-30 to at least 2026-12-15, about
46 days, because judging does not begin until December.

**ASSUMPTION**, high plausibility, and the one assumption here that cannot be validated in advance:
at that cadence there is a material chance of another deprecation round landing between feature
freeze and the end of judging. A judge opening the demo on 2026-12-10 could hit a hard 404-class
failure on a removed model identifier with nobody watching. This risk was not visible in any single
research stream. It falls out of putting the deprecation cadence next to the judging calendar.

**DECISION.** Four mitigations, all structural, because the risk cannot be prevented.

1. **One model manifest.** Every model identifier lives in a single `models.manifest.json`, never
   inlined at a call site. Each entry carries the role, the primary identifier, the declared fallback
   identifier, the region string, and the licence read from raw HuggingFace frontmatter at a pinned
   revision SHA.
2. **Build-time preflight.** The build fetches
   `https://tokenfactory.nebius.com/api/public/models_info` and fails if any referenced identifier is
   absent from `flavors[].model_id`, or if a referenced model no longer declares the `use_cases`
   entry the role needs. This also catches documentation staleness (section 3) and identifier typos
   (section 2.1) at build time instead of at demo time.
3. **Runtime fallback, exercised in CI.** Every Token Factory role has a declared fallback identifier
   in the manifest, selected automatically on a 404-class error. CI runs the fallback path on every
   build by forcing the primary identifier to fail, so the fallback is known-good rather than
   theoretical. A fallback that has never executed is not a mitigation.
4. **Catalog diff in the weekly check.** The weekly uptime check through 2026-12-15 diffs the live
   catalog against the manifest and alerts on any referenced identifier disappearing, rather than
   only pinging `/healthz`. A `/healthz` that returns 200 while the reasoning model has been removed
   is exactly the failure this is for.

**Degradation, not death.** With the fallbacks in place a deprecation during judging degrades answer
quality silently instead of killing the demo. That is the honest description of the outcome and the
one to use in the submission.

**Known gap.** The embedding role has no same-tier fallback (section 2.4), so mitigations 1, 2 and 4
apply to it but mitigation 3 does not. This is unresolved and it is the weakest point in the plan.

**A second, smaller gap.** All four mitigations sit on Token Factory. The NVIDIA licence documents
governing the model weights are separately amendable: the NVIDIA Open Model License states NVIDIA
"may update this Agreement to comply with legal and regulatory requirements at any time", where the
Nemotron Open Model License and OpenMDW-1.1 do not carry that clause. This is one more reason the
reasoning core is on the OpenMDW-1.1 model rather than on one of the models the catalog labels
`nvidia-open-model-license`.

## 7. What may and may not be claimed about NVIDIA model use

**VERIFIED, hackathon requirement, verbatim.** "All submissions must run on either Nebius Token
Factory or Nebius AI Cloud and use at least one NVIDIA open source model. Everything else is up to
you." Source: https://nebiusglobalaihackathon.devpost.com/

**VERIFIED, judging criterion, verbatim.** Technological Implementation is scored as "how effectively
does it use Nebius Token Factory or AI Cloud model(s), and NVIDIA Nemotron as part of the solution?"
Source: https://nebiusglobalaihackathon.devpost.com/rules

**SATISFIED by execution on 2026-08-27.** A real chat completion against
`nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` returned HTTP 200 with the model identifier echoed in the response
body, and the full body and response headers are archived. The platform requirement is met by
execution rather than by design. See [runtime-verification.md](runtime-verification.md) section 1,
which overrides this document on conflict.

### 7.1 What the project may say today

- That Orimera runs `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` on Nebius Token Factory, in the present tense,
  on the evidence of the archived response body and its echoed `model` field.
- That `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning` is listed in the Nebius Token Factory catalog at the stated
  price, context window and licence, citing the catalog endpoint and the retrieval date.
- That the architecture routes its reasoning to that model.
- That no model in the plan is scheduled for removal on 2026-08-31.
- The figures actually measured in [runtime-verification.md](runtime-verification.md): image token
  counts at two resolutions, the per-call reasoning-token floor, which structured-output mechanism
  the endpoint honours, the embedding width, and the measured ingestion cost.

### 7.2 What the project still may not say

- Any latency, throughput, quality or accuracy figure that has not been measured. A number is
  claimable only where this project holds the measurement that produced it.
- Anything in the present tense about an identifier that has not itself been called. Section 2 lists
  more identifiers than have been exercised, and catalog presence is not runtime behaviour.
- Any recall or precision figure for cross-capture identity, which is unmeasured and is named as
  unmeasured in [product-specification.md](product-specification.md) section 9.

### 7.3 What closed it

One successful chat completion against `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning`, with the **full response body
archived**, including the echoed `model` field (which proves which model actually served the request,
rather than which was requested) and the `x-ratelimit-*` response headers.

**DECISION.** The archived response is a stored artifact, not a screenshot and not a claim in prose,
so the model identifier can be checked against what the platform actually returned. The archive holds
personal and account-identifying response headers, so it lives in the gitignored internal workspace
rather than in the public tree, and [runtime-verification.md](runtime-verification.md) quotes the
fields that matter.

## 8. Deferred, with the reason

**DECISION.** The following are out of the plan. They are deferred with a stated reason, not quietly
dropped, and nothing in the submission will imply they exist.

| Deferred | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| ASR and word-level timestamps (`nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` and alternatives) | The corpus is photographs. There is no audio to transcribe, and Token Factory has zero audio capability regardless |
| Diarization (`nvidia/diar_streaming_sortformer_4spk-v2.1`) and speaker embeddings (`nvidia/speakerverification_en_titanet_large`) | Same. Also the reason the "recurring voices" pillar is not claimed |
| Native `video_url` input via `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` | No video in the corpus. The content part exists in the OpenAPI spec, no documentation page describes it, and no duration, FPS or token limits are published |
| Within-clip tracking (ByteTrack) and SAM 2.1 video mask propagation | Both are video-sequence operations. SAM 2.1 is retained for per-image segmentation before reconstruction |
| `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni` in every form | Removed from Serverless 2026-08-31, and its distinguishing capability (joint video plus audio with word-level timestamps) has no source material here. See `adr/0002-model-routing.md` |

**Cost of the audio deferral, stated because it is real.** The research had identified self-hosted
NVIDIA ASR on Nebius AI Cloud as a second, independent NVIDIA-compliance asset that would also have
demonstrated AI Cloud model usage directly. That asset is gone with the audio pillar. The NVIDIA
compliance story now rests entirely on the text Nemotron path on Token Factory.

**OPEN.** Whether to recover a second NVIDIA asset and an AI Cloud model-usage story by self-hosting
`nvidia/Nemotron-3-Embed-1B-BF16` (OpenMDW-1.1, 2048-dim, 32,768 max sequence) as the text embedder
in place of `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`. This would also close the fallback gap in section 2.4. It has
not been costed, it adds a deployment to the critical path, and it must not be adopted for compliance
theatre if the Qwen embedder is measurably better for retrieval. Undecided.

## 9. Open items from this document, in one place

| # | Open item | What settles it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | No model identifier has been invoked. Section 7 | One archived chat completion against `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning`, blocked on credentials (Q1) |
| 2 | Whether `use_cases` or `type` is authoritative in the catalog. Section 4 | One `image_url` call to `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3`, with `openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5` as the control |
| 3 | The embedding role has no same-tier runtime fallback. Sections 2.4 and 6 | A decision between a warm self-hosted standby, an accepted single point of failure, or freezing all embeddings before submission |
| 4 | Whether to self-host `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Embed-1B-BF16` as a second NVIDIA asset. Section 8 | A retrieval-quality comparison against `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`, plus a deployment cost estimate |
| 5 | Whether `/v1/rerank` accepts `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`. Section 2.1 | One call. The endpoint is verified to exist, the model pairing is not |
| 6 | Renderer choice, PlayCanvas versus three.js. Section 1.3 | Bake-off X-R1 by end of week 3. Recorded here only because it sits on the browser boundary |
