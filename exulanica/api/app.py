"""The application: routers, and the one place a domain error becomes a status code.

Two things live here and nothing else does.

**The error map.** Every domain error in this codebase already says precisely what went wrong,
and the API's job is to turn that into a status code without losing the distinction or inventing
one. Three of the mappings are decisions rather than conventions:

*   ``unknown_reference`` is **404, never 403**. ``evaluation-methodology.md`` M10: "404, never
    403, so the surface is not an existence oracle. Nonexistent and foreign IDs return the
    identical code." A 403 would confirm that an id exists and belongs to somebody, which is
    exactly the thing a cross-tenant probe is looking for.
*   ``not_authorised`` **is** a 403, and that is not a contradiction. It means the session may
    not do a thing it asked to do with its own workspace's data, so there is no other tenant to
    leak the existence of.
*   A tombstoned address is **410 Gone**, not 404. The user deleted it, which is a different
    fact from it never having existed, and it is a fact they are entitled to.

**The startup check.** The application verifies at boot that the schema it is about to query is
the schema its migration files describe, and refuses to start otherwise. An edited migration is a
silent schema fork, and the failure it produces later is a wrong answer rather than an error.

**The derivative worker.** ``POST /intake`` runs the intake stage in the request thread and
queues the model stages by capture id, so an instance serving that route needs something draining
the queue. It runs on a daemon thread here, started with the application and stopped with it,
because a demonstration instance is one process. Whether it runs at all is configuration: an
instance can serve the API with the queue drained somewhere else, and that instance says so
through ``/readyz`` rather than looking identical to one whose worker is wedged.

**The body limit.** :mod:`orimera.api.body_limit` refuses an over-large declared body before any
route sees it, which is the only place it can be refused before a multipart parser has already
written it to disk.
