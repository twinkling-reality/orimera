"""Refuse an over-large request body before any of it is read.

**Why this is middleware and not a check in a route.** A route function runs after the body has
been received: FastAPI reads and parses it, then resolves dependencies, then calls the handler.
By the time an upload route could look at the size, a multipart parser has already spooled every
part to a temporary file. A check there bounds what reaches the store, which matters and is
where the intake route does it, and it does not bound the disk. This runs before the application
sees the request at all, so an over-large body is refused with nothing written anywhere.

**Two bounds, because one header is not enough.** A declared ``Content-Length`` over the limit is
refused before a byte is read. A request that declares no length, which is what
``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` produces, is **counted as it arrives** and cut off the moment the
running total crosses the limit. The second is what makes the first more than a courtesy: without
it, omitting one header walks past the whole thing.

Counting costs at most one chunk past the limit, not the whole body, which is the objection to
counting and the reason it is answered by cutting off rather than by draining. A proxy in front
is still better, because it refuses before the application is involved at all, and
``docs/deployment.md`` section 5.1.2 says so.

**This runs before authentication and that is the point.** FastAPI receives and parses the body
before it resolves dependencies, so an unauthenticated request has already had its multipart
parts spooled to temporary files by the time the bearer token is looked at. Starlette bounds
``max_part_size`` for non-file parts only, so file parts are unbounded there. Middleware is
upstream of all of it.

It applies to every route rather than to the upload route alone, deliberately. A limit that has
to be remembered per route is a limit the next route will not have.

    answers to give somebody.

    **An ``HTTPException`` subclass, and that is load bearing rather than convenient.** FastAPI
    reads and parses the body inside a ``try`` whose final clause turns everything into
    ``400 There was an error parsing the body``, with one explicit exemption: ``except
    HTTPException: raise``, commented in its own source as "If a middleware raises an
    HTTPException, it should be raised again". Any other base class arrives at the client as a
    400 about a malformed request, which is the wrong answer and hides the limit that produced
    it. Measured, before this base class was chosen.
