"""Evidence resolution: the endpoint the product's promise reduces to.

Every historical factual claim resolves to the exact original source moment. This is where that
stops being a design and becomes an HTTP response, so three properties matter more here than
anywhere else in the API.

**It serves the original bytes, never a derivative.** ``resolve_original_bytes`` goes to the
content-addressed store, which re-hashes what it read before returning it, so a citation cannot
resolve to a rendition, a thumbnail, or content that has been altered since it was cited. The
region endpoint is a separate path and says so in its name: it crops the original in display
space, applying the same orientation transform ingest applied, and it is a convenience for the
interface rather than what a citation resolves to.

**A span from another workspace is a 404, not a 403.** ``evaluation-methodology.md`` M10 is
explicit: "404, never 403, so the surface is not an existence oracle. Nonexistent and foreign IDs
return the identical code." That is not achieved by a check in this module; it is achieved by the
query being scoped to the caller's workspace under row-level security, so a foreign span is
simply not there. The two cases share a code because they share a code path.

**Range requests are supported**, because the original of a photograph is a few megabytes and a
citation deep link should not have to transfer all of it to show the top of it. The
implementation is deliberately the boring one: a single byte range, a 206 with ``Content-Range``,
and a 416 with the unsatisfied-range header when the request is out of bounds.

**The response carries the citation's wall clock and the uncertainty of it**, in headers, because
a client showing "this was taken at 10:00" needs to know how well that is known. The domain model
is specific: wall-clock queries are "translated through the anchor table and the uncertainty of
that translation is carried into the answer rather than rounded away". An EXIF timestamp with no
zone is a real and common state, and it is knowable to within hours rather than seconds. Headers
rather than a second metadata endpoint, because the client needs them at the moment it renders
the bytes and a second round trip to learn them would be a second thing to get out of step.
