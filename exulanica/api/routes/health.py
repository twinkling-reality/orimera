"""Liveness and readiness, which are two signals and must not be one.

``deployment.md`` section 6 specifies both, and the distinction is not pedantry: a deployment has
to survive stretches of roughly 46 days unattended, an external probe runs every five minutes, and
the two questions have different costs and different answers.

*   **Liveness**, ``GET /healthz``, costs nothing beyond the process itself and checks only
    that the process is running and can serve a request. No dependency is touched.
*   **Readiness**, ``GET /readyz``, costs one cheap query and one cheap object-store call, and
    checks that the dependencies a request actually needs are reachable.

Three things readiness must not do, from section 6.3, and each is implemented as an absence
rather than as a comment:

*   **It must not call a model.** 13,200 checks over that unattended stretch, each spending
    roughly 200 reasoning tokens before producing any output, and worse, health would then go
    red the day the prepaid balance ran out for a reason that has nothing to do with the service
    being up. There is no model call anywhere in this module.
*   **It must not claim more than it checks.** A 200 from ``/healthz`` says the process is
    alive. It does not say the reasoning model still exists in the catalog; that is the
    scheduled ``exulanica-preflight`` run, and readiness reports the manifest parsing rather than
    the catalog agreeing.
*   **It must not be expensive enough to matter**, because a readiness check that is costly gets
    turned off or becomes the thing that falls over.

Neither endpoint is authorised, and that is the one deliberate exception to "every endpoint is
authorised". A liveness probe that needed a credential would be a liveness probe that goes red
when the credential rotates. Neither returns anything about the contents of any workspace.
