"""The mutation surface. Small, explicit, and structurally unable to say who decided.

``architecture-overview.md`` 1.1 states the front-end rule this mirrors: "``graph-client`` is the
only module permitted to mutate, and it rejects any mutation whose proposal id is not in the
pending proposal set. This is a runtime check, not a lint rule. It exists because the product's
epistemic guarantee is that the system may organize on a guess but never assert on one, and that
guarantee is worthless if any UI component can write an assertion."

The server side of that guarantee is two things:

*   **No request model here has an actor field.** ``decided_by`` and ``stated_by_user`` come from
    the bearer token, so what lands in the column is who the credential belongs to and not what
    the caller typed. A confirmed link records a human decision because the transport cannot
    express any other kind.
*   **A mutation that confirms a system proposal must name it**, and the server checks that the
    proposal is pending and belongs to this workspace before applying anything. A stale proposal
    id, a proposal already answered, or one from another workspace is refused identically.

A mutation the user originates has no proposal to name, and requiring one would be requiring the
system to have guessed first. Naming somebody, or confirming a person the user picked themselves
in the interface, is a statement rather than an agreement, and it carries the actor and nothing
else. That is the line: agreeing with the system needs the system's proposal; speaking for
yourself does not.
