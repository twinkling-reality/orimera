"""The read surface: resolve a Selection, and answer a question from one.

Both routes are thin to the point of being boring, and that is the design. A Selection arriving
from the interface and a Selection arriving from the Companion are the same object by the time
they reach :func:`exulanica.selection.validation.validate`, and neither route knows which surface
produced the plan it was handed. ADR-0005: "nothing else in the system knows where a Selection
came from."

Three things the routes do that are not delegation, each of which is a boundary rather than
logic:

*   They open a **read-only connection**, as the executor role when one is configured.
*   They take the workspace and the actor **from the session**, so no request body has a field
    for either.
*   ``POST /selection/plan`` returns a proposed Selection and does not run it, because ADR-0005
    requires that a conversational Selection is "shown to the user before it is applied". The
    caller applies it by posting it back to ``POST /selection``.
