"""What a running instance is wired to, resolved once at startup rather than per request.

Four things, and the interesting one is the second.

*   **A write database and a read database.** The Selection executor is specified to connect as
    ``exulanica_ro``, "a non-owner role that owns nothing and lacks BYPASSRLS", so that the step of
    the pipeline running a plan derived from model output cannot write whatever happened
    upstream of it. That is a second connection string, and when it is absent this says so at
    startup instead of quietly running queries as the writer. A defence that is off and silent
    is worse than one that is absent, because it still reads as present.
*   **The object store**, which is what an evidence citation resolves against.
*   **The model client**, built lazily. Two endpoints out of the whole surface need a model, and
    an instance with no credential should serve the other endpoints rather than refuse to start.
*   **Whether this instance drains the derivative queue.** ``POST /intake`` runs the intake stage
    in the request and queues the rest by capture id, so something has to drain it. In one
    process that is a daemon thread here. An instance that leaves it to somebody else says so in
    ``/readyz``, because a queue nobody drains and a queue drained elsewhere look identical from
    the outside and only one of them is a deployment.

Nothing here is a global. The application holds one :class:`Services` and hands it to routes
through a dependency, so a test builds its own and a second instance in one process is possible
rather than a thing that would need to be discovered.

        **The worker is handed the workspaces as a value.** ``exulanica.ingest`` sits under

        find out which workspaces exist would invert the layering, and ``uv run lint-imports``
        says so rather than a reviewer.

        **No depth model**, deliberately. The reconstruction stack is a large optional
        dependency and an API image that carries it is a different image. An uploaded photograph
        is therefore rung 4 until a reconstruction pass runs, which ``warnings`` states rather
        than leaves to be discovered.

        **The lease is computed here because this is the only place that can compute it.** How
        long a claimant may be silent depends on the longest model call it can be inside, and
        that is a property of the client rather than of the role: this builds ``ModelClient()``
        with a 180 second timeout and one attempt while ``exulanica-ingest`` builds one with three,

        decides whether there is a vision model at all, so the two cannot disagree: no client
        means no vision model and the floor, and that is a stated deployment rather than an
        oversight. Reading a budget off the vision model instead would mean widening a protocol
        whose whole point is that the pipeline needs two things from a model, and would break
