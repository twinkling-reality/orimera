"""Canonical JSON and the one rounding rule, both of which feed digests.

Everything in this module exists because a digest input must serialise the same way forever,
on every machine, in every language that later reads an Orimera package. Two rules do the
work:

1.  **No floats, anywhere, ever, in a digest input.** IEEE 754 has no canonical decimal
    rendering that every JSON writer agrees on, so a float in a digest input is a latent
    cross-language mismatch. Callers quantise to integers first (see
    ``orimera.evidence.region`` for how normalised coordinates become integers).
2.  **One rounding rule**, ``round_half_down``, used by both the nanosecond/tick conversion in
    ``orimera.evidence.timebase`` and the coordinate quantisation in
    ``orimera.evidence.region``, implemented in exact integer arithmetic.

The canonical form is a strict subset of RFC 8785 (JCS): sorted keys, no insignificant
whitespace, UTF-8. Because floats are rejected outright, the only place this could diverge
from JCS is string escaping, and Python's ``json`` module already emits the same short escapes
that ECMAScript ``JSON.stringify`` does.
