"""The capture plan: which camera stood where, when, and what the file will claim about it.

Everything a generated photograph will assert about itself is decided here and recorded, so the
manifest the generator writes is the plan rather than a description written after the fact. That
matters for `docs/evaluation-methodology.md`: a ground truth derived from the same run that
produced the images cannot drift from them.

Four properties are arranged deliberately rather than left to chance, because each one is a code
path the ingest pipeline has and that a tidy corpus would never reach.

*   **Two visits to one place, months apart.** Scene grouping clusters on time and position, so a
    place photographed twice must produce two groups and not one. A corpus visited once cannot
    tell a working clusterer from one that returns everything.
*   **A device that writes no UTC offset.** `orimera/ingest/exif.py` carries a 26-hour
    uncertainty for exactly this case and it is the common one in real libraries. Half this
    corpus is shot on a device that writes `OffsetTimeOriginal` and half on one that does not.
*   **Photographs with no GPS at all.** The indoor trip has no fix, which is what actually
    happens indoors, and it forces grouping to fall back to time alone.
*   **Orientations including mirrored ones.** Four of the eight EXIF orientation values include a
    flip, and `media_track.rotation` cannot express one. The corpus contains mirrored frames so
    that the normalisation path is exercised rather than assumed.

**The coordinates are fabricated.** They are internally consistent, far enough apart to cluster
separately and close enough together to be one city, and they point at no place anybody has been.
Nothing in this package should ever be read as a record of somewhere real.
