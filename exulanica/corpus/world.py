"""The arrangements the corpus photographs: three places, and the objects that travel between them.

Two kinds of thing live here and the distinction is the whole point of the corpus.

*   A **place** is a fixed arrangement that does not move between visits. Photographing it twice,
    months apart, is what gives scene grouping two clusters to separate and continuity something
    to recognise.
*   A **subject** is a small object that appears in more than one place and in more than one
    visit. It is what an identity path has to link across captures, and it is deliberately not a
    person: `docs/privacy-consent-threat-model.md` section 10 leaves the biometric question to a
    human, and a synthetic corpus that shipped synthetic faces would prejudge it by supplying the
    training input for the very thing that has not been decided.

**Every solid is convex and no two interpenetrate.** That is what makes the painter's algorithm
in `render.py` exact rather than approximate, and it is a property of the arrangements below
rather than of the renderer. Adding a solid that intersects another one changes the correctness
of the renderer, so it is recorded in both files.

Colours are muted and slightly desaturated on purpose. A saturated primary reads as a rendering,
and while nothing here pretends to be a photograph, a corpus whose every frame screams "computer
graphics" would exercise the vision stage on input unlike anything the product will ever see.

#: cannot know what a model will call a low-poly carmine box: "satchel", "red bag", "red cube",
#: "maroon box". Everything else in MANIFEST.json is a fact the generator produced; this is the

#: scored against the corpus, and M6 turned out not to be a corpus metric at all: it filters on

#: what measures why a manifest-derived filter metric would not have been worth having anyway.

#: and reports, per subject, how much of the generator's own placement a detector recovered. That

#: as a filter defect is the "blocked" and "scored zero" conflation the whole report refuses.
#:
