"""The one data layer. PostgreSQL 18 with pgvector, and nothing beside it.

There used to be two: the spine in ``orimera/migrations/0001_spine.sql`` and a portable SQLite
mirror that the ingest path actually wrote. The mirror existed because no PostgreSQL with
pgvector was available when ingestion was written, and it was a fork waiting to happen: the
epistemic guards that carry the product's central promise exist only in PostgreSQL, and a
second schema is a second thing to keep true.

This package holds what every caller of the spine needs and no caller should reimplement:
opening a connection with a workspace attached, and applying the migration files.
