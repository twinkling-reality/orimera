"""``exulanica-db``: bring a database up to the schema and the roles this code expects.

One command, because there is only one correct order and offering a second way to ask is
offering a way to get it wrong. Migrations first, then the three runtime roles.

**Run it as the SAME role that applies migrations.** ``provision_runtime_role`` ends with
``alter default privileges ... grant ... on tables``, and PostgreSQL applies default privileges
only to objects created by the role that executed that statement. Provision as one principal and
migrate as another and the grants stop covering tables a later migration adds, which surfaces as
``permission denied`` from a route rather than from here.

Passwords are optional. ``provision_runtime_role`` sets one only when given one, and a deployment
authenticating by certificate or by peer has none to set; inventing one would be creating a
credential nobody asked for.
