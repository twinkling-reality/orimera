"""Applying migration files to a server, and recording what was applied.

``exulanica.migrations`` knows what the files are and what they hash to. This module is the half
that talks to a database: it reads ``schema_migrations``, applies whatever is pending, and
records the checksum of each file it applied so that :func:`exulanica.migrations.verify_applied`
has something to compare against later.

Three properties, each of which is a decision rather than an accident:

*   **Bootstrapping is explicit.** ``schema_migrations`` is created by migration 0001, so the
    first read of it happens before it exists. An undefined-table error is treated as "nothing
    has been applied", and only that error.
*   **Each file is applied exactly as it is on disk.** No substitutions, no string rewriting.
    A file that will not run here is a file that will not run in production either, and the
    only useful thing to do about that is to fail.
*   **Recording is a separate statement after the file commits.** A migration carries its own
    ``commit;``, so the bookkeeping row cannot ride inside the same transaction. The window
    between them is the one failure mode this leaves open: a crash there applies a migration
    without recording it, and the next run tries to reapply it and fails loudly on an object
    that already exists. Loud is the right direction; recording first would instead let a
    partially applied schema look complete.
