"""``exulanica-purge``: destroy the bytes the tombstones asked for, and say what it did.

**A command rather than something the API does by itself, by default.** Erasure is the one
irreversible thing this system performs, and a demonstration instance that quietly destroyed
files on a timer would be the wrong default to arrive at by saying nothing. The
:class:`~exulanica.deletion.worker.PurgeWorker` can run on a thread, and an operator turns it on
with a credential; this is the way to run it once, watch what it did, and run it again.

**It connects as its own role.** ``EXULANICA_PURGE_DATABASE_URL`` names ``exulanica_purge``
(or the ``exulanica_purge`` alias), and its
absence is refused rather than defaulted to the writer. That is not ceremony: the purge role has
a cross-workspace read the runtime role must never have, and the runtime role has writes the
purger must never need. Running as the wrong one either destroys another tenant's photograph or
cannot tell that it would.
