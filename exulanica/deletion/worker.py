"""The worker that destroys bytes. The order it does things in is the whole of it.

Per job, and none of these may be reordered:

1.  **Take the advisory lock**, keyed on the target's content hash, so two purgers never work on
    one object. ``purge_lock_object`` raises rather than silently taking no lock, which is
    correction 1: the lock was absent on exactly the rows it was added for.
2.  **Ask whether the bytes may go**, inside the same transaction and after the lock, so the
    answer cannot go stale between asking and acting. ``purge_releases_bytes`` raises on a NULL
    hash rather than answering "yes", which is correction 2: it failed OPEN.
3.  **Destroy the object**, through the separately authorised purger, which cannot be
    constructed without naming the tombstone, the actor and the reason. Those come off the
    tombstone row.
4.  **Confirm it is gone**, by asking the store. A purge that reported success over an object
    still on disk is the one failure this whole package exists to prevent, and the store is the
    only thing that can answer.
5.  **Record it**, and only then. The store is not in the transaction, so a row marked purged
    before the object is destroyed lies when the process dies in between, and lies in the
    direction that stops anything trying again.

**A job whose bytes something still holds is ``skipped``, and skipped comes back.** That is
correction 3. It is not a failure: another live capture, in this workspace or another, is using
those exact bytes, and the right thing is to ask again later.

**What this cannot do.** It holds no DELETE on any table; the purge role is granted none. It
destroys objects and marks rows. Row deletion is not something this system does: 0001 keeps the
``blob`` stub so a citation into deleted content resolves to "the user deleted this" rather than
to nothing at all.

**The cross-workspace read is a privilege of the role, not of this code, and this asks.**
``provision_purge_role`` grants ``exulanica_purge`` a permissive SELECT policy on ``capture`` and
``artifact``, because ``blob`` is shared between workspaces and a purger that could only see its
own would destroy another tenant's photograph. ``EXULANICA_PURGE_DATABASE_URL`` is only a name, so
:func:`exulanica.deletion.queue.read_visibility` asks the database which role is connected and
whether that policy applies to it, and this refuses to destroy anything when it does not.
Measured with the writer's URL in that variable: one object destroyed, zero skipped, the
tombstone recorded complete, and another workspace's live photograph gone, with nothing in the
outcome naming the role or the narrowed view.

**The advisory lock is taken by BOTH sides, and only one of them used to take it.**
``purge_lock_object`` serialises purger against purger. It did not serialise a purger against an
ingest, and measured: workspace A's purger asks whether the bytes may go, workspace B commits a
live capture of the same bytes in the window, and the purger destroys an object B is using, along
the deduplication path where B writes no bytes at all because they were already there.
``IngestRepository.lock_stored_object`` is the other side.
