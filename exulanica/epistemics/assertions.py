"""Writing a claim, under exactly one of the four provenance classes.

This is the one place assertions are written. It was inside the ingest repository, which was
fine while ingest was the only writer; it is not fine now that the identity path writes the
``kind='user'`` naming assertion that ``entity.display_name`` depends on. A second
implementation of "insert an assertion" would be a second place for the support-span rule, the
allows-kind check and the tombstone translation to drift out of step, and each of those is an
invariant rather than a detail.

The four classes are never flattened, and each has a different obligation:

*   ``capture`` and ``inference`` must cite at least one evidence span. A model output with no
    evidence is not an inference, it is a rumour, and the schema refuses it as
    ``inference_support_required``.
*   ``inference`` must name the run that produced it.
*   ``user`` must name the person who said it, and must NOT name a run: migration 0002 adds
    ``a_user_statement_has_no_producing_run`` because a claim the user made was not produced by
    a pipeline, and the laundering route that motivated it kept exactly that column set.
*   ``external`` is a claim about a public entity in the present, never about the user's past.

What is checked here duplicates nothing the database does not also check. The database is the
guarantee; these checks exist for the error message, and the difference matters because a
refusal that says "predicate 'name_is' does not accept an 'inference' assertion; it allows
['user']" is actionable and ``SQLSTATE 23000`` is not.
