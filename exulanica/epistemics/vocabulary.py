"""Every predicate in the vocabulary, and the decision somebody made when adding it.

This exists because of defect R4. ``predicate.writes_a_name`` is what stops a model writing a
name: ``a_name_comes_only_from_the_user`` refuses a row that declares itself a naming predicate
while permitting any kind but ``user``, and ``tg_entity_name_is_user_stated`` reads the flag
rather than the key, so a later ``nickname_is`` cannot escape by being spelled differently. Both
rules are downstream of one boolean that whoever adds the row types.

Whether a predicate's object IS a name is a semantic property. A database cannot decide it, a
regex over keys was rejected in migration 0001 for a reason that still holds, and a classifier
would be a model deciding what models may write. So this file does not enforce the property. It
makes the answer a written sentence in a reviewed diff, beside the boolean it justifies, instead
of a ``false`` in the fourth column of a values tuple that nobody reads twice.

Stated plainly, because the point of the file is to stop overclaiming: **a wrong entry here is
accepted.** What this closes is the row added without anybody answering the question. Migration
0007 removes the column's default so omission raises, and
``tests/test_vocabulary_decisions.py`` refuses a predicate that reached a migration without a
decision reaching this file.

On the scope of the flag. It asks what a PERSON is called, because ``entity.display_name`` is
what invariant 4 protects. ``place_is`` is a proper noun a model may write and it is still false,
and the reason is checkable rather than asserted: ``display_name`` is set only where an active
``kind='user'`` assertion under a ``writes_a_name`` predicate says so, and that flag is
constrained to user-only predicates, so no inference can reach the column whatever it writes.
``tests/test_identity.py`` holds that as a probe rather than as a paragraph.
