"""Every component of every metric, and what a result for it may and may not license.

One row per row of ``docs/evaluation-methodology.md`` section 6, because that is the unit the
methodology actually classifies. ``kind`` cannot hang off a metric: section 6.1 lists "M8 parse,
execution, schema validity" as enforced and section 6.2 lists "M8 plan semantic accuracy" as
learned, and the same split runs through M1 and M5. A per-metric kind would force a choice the
document deliberately refuses to make.

``licenses`` and ``withholds`` are copied verbatim, and the second is the one that matters. It is
what stops a report being read as more than it is, and section 6.1's entry for M10 authorization
is the clearest example in the document: the sweep licenses "no cross-tenant read succeeded on
any route generated from the router" and explicitly does NOT license that anonymous asset URLs are
protected. "They are not, and the report says so."
