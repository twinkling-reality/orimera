    :func:`orimera.selection.validation.validate`, then to
    :func:`orimera.selection.executor.execute`. That ordering is not a style choice: ``execute``
    accepts only a ``ValidatedPlan`` and ``validate`` is the only thing that constructs one, so
    there is no way to reach the executor that skips a stage. A defect anywhere in parse,
    validation, compilation or the SQL makes a case here fail.

    **Why this dimension and no other.** Capture time is the one dimension of a Selection whose
    gold set is ground truth rather than the system's own output. The corpus generator WROTE the
    instants into the files and recorded them in ``MANIFEST.json``; every other dimension is
    either an entity, which exists only where a person confirmed one, or a property the pipeline
    derived, and a gold set derived from the system's output measures nothing.

    **What a failure here does not distinguish, and the report says so.** Two things can make a
    frame miss its window: the filter, or the instant the pipeline stored for it. The evidence on
    each failing case prints both the manifest's instant and the stored one, so a reader can tell
    which of the two they are looking at without rerunning anything.

        cannot adjudicate whether it belonged in the window.
    *   The result holds captures outside this corpus, which is not a failure and not scoreable
        either: the manifest has no ground truth for them.

    The first two make a case unscoreable and are counted into a named case of their own. The
    third is counted and reported and does not stop a case scoring, because a capture the
    manifest never described cannot be evidence for or against a claim about the manifest. It is
    counted once per capture rather than once per window it appeared in: the windows overlap, so
    the two numbers differ and only the first is the one the sentence claims.
