"""Normalised spatial regions, quantised to integers so a digest can survive a language change.

The committed schema says a region is normalised to ``[0, 1]`` in **display** space, after
orientation is applied, and that the region is an input to ``span_digest``. It does not say how
the numbers are encoded, and that gap is load bearing: a JSON float in a digest input has no
canonical rendering that every implementation agrees on, so ``0.312`` written by Python and
``0.312`` written by a future Rust reader could hash differently while denoting the same box.

**Decision taken here:** coordinates are integers in parts per million of the normalised unit
square, ``0 .. 1_000_000``. One ppm of a 6000 pixel wide photograph is 0.006 px, so the
quantisation is far below any detector's own precision, and it makes the digest exact.
Conversion from a float uses ``Fraction`` for an exact binary value and then the project's one
rounding rule, so quantisation is deterministic rather than platform dependent.

Regions are non-empty for the same reason intervals are: a zero-area box overlaps nothing, and
a guard that tests overlap would silently pass it.
