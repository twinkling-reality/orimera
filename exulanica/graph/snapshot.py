"""Assemble one graph snapshot at one state version.

The parts are read on one connection in one request so that they were all true at the same
state version. A grouping fetched at a different moment from the graph it groups can disagree
with it, and the whole value of a snapshot is that its parts agree.

Two reads are inline rather than named. They are one statement each with no shape worth a
function: the pairs a split declared can never be the same person, and the entities that have
been deleted.
