"""One user decision, applied as one transaction, recorded so that undo is exact.

Five decisions live here: confirm, reject, revoke, merge and split, plus the naming of an
occurrence. Their shared vocabulary is in :mod:`exulanica.identity.subjects`, their inverses are in
:mod:`exulanica.identity.undo`, and renaming an entity is in :mod:`exulanica.identity.naming`. The
split happened when this file passed 700 lines and was holding three responsibilities at once.

Every function here is a thing a person did. There is no function a model can call, and that is
structural rather than a matter of discipline: ``confirmed_needs_a_human`` refuses a confirmed
link without a ``decided_by`` and ``method = 'user_confirm'``, and
``tg_entity_name_is_user_stated`` refuses a name that no active ``kind='user'`` assertion
supports. A caller that wanted to promote a guess would have to defeat the database.

**A name is not stored, it is derived.** :func:`name_occurrence` writes the naming assertion
first and sets ``entity.display_name`` second, and the second write succeeds only because the
first one exists. Retracting the assertion clears the column. The column is a cache of the
claim, never the claim itself, which is what makes "the user changed their mind" a single write
rather than a cleanup job.

**Rejection memory is keyed by evidence and by basis.** A rejection says "not this occurrence,
not this entity, not on this evidence". Keyed by ``occurrence_id`` instead, the next detector
run mints a new id for the same thing in the same photograph and the rejected proposal comes
straight back forever. Keyed without the basis, a genuinely better signal set could never ask
again, which is the opposite failure and just as bad.

**What is deliberately absent.** No function here computes, stores or compares an embedding of
any kind. Identity is established by the account holder pointing at a photograph and saying who
that is. Automatic proposal from non-biometric signals (time proximity, scene grouping, place,
co-occurrence) is the next rung and would write ``match_proposal`` rows through
:meth:`exulanica.identity.proposals.Proposals.record`; face embeddings are a separate decision with
legal weight and open item P-1 has not been answered.
