"""What must be recomputed because of this decision?

``derived_artifact.dep_index`` is the flattened ``'kind:<uuid>'`` form with a GIN index over it,
precisely so invalidation is a query rather than a hand-maintained list of things to remember. A
generated title naming somebody has to become stale when that person is merged away, or the name
survives its own deletion inside a caption.

**The kinds are named in the signature rather than taken as keywords.** The flattening used to be
a free ``**subjects`` helper, which meant ``mark_stale(entty=x)`` was a well-formed call that
produced a key nothing indexes and reported a confident zero. There are two kinds of dependency
an identity decision touches, they are spelled here, and a third is a deliberate edit.
