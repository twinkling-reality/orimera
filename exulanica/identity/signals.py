"""What corroborates that two occurrences in different photographs are the same thing.

Three signals, all of them context. None of them is biometric and none of them can become one
from here: there is no face model, no audio for a voice model and no video for gait, and the
decision that would permit a face embedding belongs to a human and has not been made.
``privacy-consent-threat-model.md`` section 10 records the three incompatible candidate rules and
says the choice must be made before identity work begins. It has not been, so this module works
without it, which is possible because a bounding box saying somebody is present is outside that
question and person occurrences already exist.

**A detector label is not one of these signals.** Twenty-seven captures containing *a* red cube do
not contain *the* red cube. Label equality is a hard constraint applied before any of this runs,
a refusal of nonsense rather than evidence of sameness, and treating it as a signal is the single
easiest way to build a system that confidently proposes that every red cube is the same cube.

Time proximity is not a modality either. It is not in the closed id-4 vocabulary and inventing a
seventh member to hold it is exactly the drift migration 0008's CHECK exists to stop. It enters
through ``context_cooccurrence``, because a scene group is built from time and position, and it
is recorded as a parameter rather than claimed as a signal.

These functions read tables that ingest wrote and identity did not: ``capture``,
``derived_artifact``, and ``assertion`` under ``gps_position_is``. Reading a table is not
importing a module, so the layer contract is untouched, but the string ``'scene_group'`` is
written in ``orimera/ingest/scenes.py`` and read here, and a test pins the two together because a
literal duplicated across a boundary nothing checks is a literal that drifts.
