"""Downscaled renditions: the only pixels a model ever sees.

**Size.** Image tokens are strongly sub-linear in pixel area: 277 prompt tokens at 256 px and
772 at 768 px, so nine times the area costs 2.8 times the tokens. The instinct to downscale
hard is therefore a false economy. It costs the legible signage that the OCR and the place
proposal both depend on, and it saves a fraction of a cent per thousand photographs. The
rendition is 768 px on the long edge.

**Never upscale.** A small original is sent at its own size. Enlarging it adds tokens and no
information, and it invites a model to read detail that is not there.

**The rendition carries no EXIF.** Two reasons, and the second is the important one:

1.  The pixels are already upright, so a surviving orientation tag would make a viewer rotate
    them a second time.
2.  It is data minimisation with teeth. EXIF is where the GPS fix, the device serial and the
    owner name live. Stripping it means the bytes that leave this machine for an inference
    endpoint contain the photograph and nothing else. The provider does not need the user's
    coordinates to describe a waterfall.
