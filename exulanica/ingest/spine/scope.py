"""A connection that has declared which workspace it speaks for.

This exists to be the first parameter of every function in this package, so that "the
connection under this statement declared a workspace" is a property of the type rather than a
property of the caller's memory. There is no constructor that skips
:func:`~orimera.db.session.set_workspace`, so there is no way to hand a spine module an
undeclared connection.

**The scoping is doubled today, and that is worth stating rather than discovering.** A
connection handed to :class:`~orimera.ingest.repository.IngestRepository` is declared twice:
once here, and once by :class:`~orimera.epistemics.assertions.AssertionWriter`, which the
repository also constructs and which calls ``set_workspace`` on the same connection. So
deleting either call leaves the connection scoped anyway, and a test that reverts one of them
and expects a failure passes for the wrong reason. Measured. Neither call is redundant in the
sense that it can be removed: the assertion writer is constructed directly by
``orimera.identity`` on connections that never see a repository, and this class is the whole of
what makes a spine module safe to call. What is false is the idea that either one is *load
bearing for the other*, and the rule this package actually holds is structural, not behavioural:
see the package docstring.
