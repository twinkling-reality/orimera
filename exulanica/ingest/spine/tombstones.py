"""What the user asked to have gone, and whether a write is covered by it.

This module owns ``_multirange``, the adapter from a sequence of half-open nanosecond intervals
to the ``int8multirange`` the schema stores, and ``occurrences`` imports it from here. Three
choices, each of which had a plausible alternative:

*   **Not a module of its own.** A file whose whole content is a two-line driver adapter that
    two siblings both need is a helpers module wearing a domain-sounding name.
*   **Here rather than in ``occurrences``.** ``tombstone.interval_ns`` is the one column in this
    data layer whose entire content *is* an interval set: an interval redaction is nothing but a
    statement about a range of time, while ``occurrence.presence`` is, in migration 0001's own
    words, a "union of span intervals".
*   **Shared rather than written out twice.** The ``[)`` bound is not a style choice. Migration
    0001 line 925 matches ``interval_ns`` against
    ``int8multirange(int8range(p_start_ns, p_end_ns, '[)'))``, so a presence written under any
    other convention would be measured by this guard under a convention it does not use, and two
    copies of the expression are two places for that to drift.

It stays private because the rule this package holds is about its public surface: every public
function takes a :class:`~orimera.ingest.spine.scope.WorkspaceScope` first, and a pure value
adapter that never sees a connection would be the sole exception to a rule better kept without
any.

    true is to ask first and write nothing until the answer is no.

    It asks the same question the ``before insert`` trigger on ``evidence_span`` will ask later,
    under the assumption this ingest will register a live capture for these bytes, which it will.
    The two therefore agree: this never refuses an import the trigger would have allowed, and
    never allows one it would have refused. The trigger is not redundant, because a tombstone may
    be committed in between; it is the one that closes the race, and this one is what keeps the
    store clean in the overwhelmingly common case where there is no race at all.
