"""Stage 2. A 768 px display-space JPEG with no EXIF: the only pixels a model ever sees.

The short circuit at the top is not an optimisation with a correctness caveat. A rendition that
is already encoded and already in the store is the finished output of this stage, and decoding
the original again to rebuild bytes that exist would be the expensive way to reach the same
artifact row. The reuse is still recorded, because a stage satisfied without running is a step
in the graph and the Assembly Replay is generated from the ledger and from nothing else.
