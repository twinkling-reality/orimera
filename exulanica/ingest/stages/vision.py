"""Stage 3. One structured call over the rendition, filed as inference and never as anything else.

Every row this stage writes is ``kind='inference'`` and carries at least one evidence address.
There is no branch that could write one as ``capture``: the predicate vocabulary refuses it at
the data layer, so the discipline here is a convenience and the guarantee is in the schema.

The reuse branch is the whole cost control. A second run of a directory reaches it for every
photograph and issues no model call at all. It is also where an edited prompt or a swapped
model correctly misses, because both are inside the key: the prompt through
``params["prompt_sha256"]`` and the model through the run-time binding.
