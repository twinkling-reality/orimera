"""The worker that finishes an upload: rendition, vision, depth, scenes, proposals.

**It does not import the API and it must not start.** ``exulanica.ingest`` sits under
``exulanica.api`` in the layers contract, so a worker reaching for
``exulanica.api.authorisation`` to find out which workspaces exist inverts the layering, and
``uv run lint-imports`` says so. It takes the workspaces as a value instead. The application
knows them because they came from its token directory, and passing them down is one argument
rather than a dependency.

**What runs here and what does not.** The vision stage is a model call and belongs nowhere near
a request thread. The intake stage is a hash, an EXIF read, an orientation transform and a few
rows, and it has already happened by the time a job is claimed: see
:mod:`exulanica.ingest.derivative_queue` for why the split is where it is. So this drains capture
ids, computes derivatives from bytes already in the content-addressed store, and closes the
batch that was watching.

**The batch is closed here rather than by the request**, because a batch's terminal event is what
tells a client to stop listening and it has to come after all the work. A request that closed the
batch it opened would emit "finished" while the vision stage had not started.

**Scene grouping and match proposals run at the end of a job**, through
:func:`exulanica.ingest.continuity.run_continuity`, which is the same call
``exulanica-ingest`` makes at the end of a directory. Inside the batch, so
continuity search appears in the formation stream
as the stage it is: left out, a watched upload would stop after entity indexing and finish with
no account of the gap.

**A claim is a lease this worker keeps saying it still holds.** An independent connection renews
it while a rendition, model call, depth forward or continuity pass is running, and stage
boundaries check the same token. When either path says the lease has been taken, this worker does
nothing further to that job: it does not finish it and it does not close its batch, because the
worker that took the lease owns both. Measured without that check, with two real processes: two
terminal events for one batch 4.5 seconds apart, `succeeded` then `failed`, the second
contradicting the first.

**One delivery thread plus one lease thread, and both say what they did.** Delivery remains a
synchronous worker over a synchronous driver, polling the measured tenant-and-kind queue index.
PostgreSQL is the job system: bounded exponential retries, expired-lease reclaim and terminal
exhaustion stay in the same transactions as the job row and durable delivery ledger. A separate
broker would add a second source of truth without evidence that this queue misses its contract.
