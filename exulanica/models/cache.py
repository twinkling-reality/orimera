"""The response cache. Invariant 6: idempotency keyed by content hash and pipeline version.

This is a cost control before it is a correctness one. A full corpus pass costs about $0.41 and
ten development iterations over the same photographs cost ten times that for identical answers.
Re-running ingest must not re-bill.

**The key is ``(input content hash, pipeline version, role, prompt version)``.** Each of the four
is load bearing:

*   *input content hash* over the canonical request, so identical work hits.
*   *pipeline version* from the manifest, so replacing a model identifier invalidates every
    answer the replaced model produced. A cache that outlives the model that filled it is a
    correctness bug wearing a cost saving's coat.
*   *role*, so vision answers and reasoning answers cannot collide.
*   *prompt version*, so editing a prompt invalidates the answers it produced. Editing a prompt
    and silently getting the old prompt's answers is the failure that wastes an afternoon.

**The resolved model identifier is deliberately NOT in the key.** A fallback swap during a
deprecation must still hit the cache, otherwise a withdrawal turns into a full re-bill on top of
a quality regression. The identifier that actually served each entry is recorded *in* the entry,
so provenance survives even though it does not participate in lookup.

Digest input goes through ``orimera.canonical``, the same canonical JSON the evidence spine uses.
That module refuses floats outright, which is right for a citation digest and inconvenient here
because ``temperature`` is a float, so floats are converted to a tagged repr string first. The
tagged form is injective, so no payload can forge a tag and be served another payload's stored
response, but it is stable only within a process family and would not be sound for anything
that has to be reproduced by another implementation.

    """Encode a request payload injectively, in a form ``orimera.canonical`` accepts.

    Floats become a tagged string rather than being rejected. ``orimera.canonical`` bans floats
    because a citation digest must serialise identically in every language forever; a cache key
    has no such obligation, and the tag keeps ``0.0`` from colliding with the string ``"0.0"``.

    A payload mapping is tagged for the same reason, and it is the half that was missing. While
    a mapping passed through unwrapped, the float ``0.0`` and the mapping ``{"__float__":
    "0.0"}`` both encoded to ``{"__float__": "0.0"}`` and shared one cache entry, so one request
    could be answered with another request's response. Tagged, the three dict-valued encodings
    are disjoint single-key namespaces and a payload mapping can only ever reach ``__map__``.
    A payload that spells the tag itself lands one wrapper deeper, always, so there is no depth
    at which it catches up.

    Injective over what a request payload can be on the wire, which is what this digest covers.
    Two mapping keys differing only in type still collapse, because ``str`` is applied to both
    and JSON has one kind of object name; a payload that reached the endpoint could not have
    told them apart either.
