"""Turning a response body into a result a caller may believe.

Separated from the client because these are the checks that decide whether a reply enters
canonical state, and the client's other job is reaching the network. The four refusals here are
each the answer to something measured:

*   ``finish_reason: "length"`` with nothing written is a ``max_tokens`` that does not clear the
    reasoning overhead. It reads exactly like a model that cannot do the task and is not one; it
    produced one false negative in this project's own verification harness.
*   ``finish_reason: "length"`` with a partial answer is never salvaged. Half a result that
    happens to parse is a plausible fact with a piece missing.
*   A reasoning block that was opened and never closed was cut mid-thought while the endpoint
    reported an ordinary stop. ``finish_reason`` cannot see that one.
*   A reply is validated locally against the byte-identical schema that was sent, because
    sending a schema is a request and not a guarantee. ``guided_json`` proved on this platform
    that a constraint parameter can be accepted, ignored, and answered with an HTTP 200 that
    looks fine.
