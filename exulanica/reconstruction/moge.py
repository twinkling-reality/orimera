"""MoGe-2 behind the depth protocol.

``docs/model-and-service-selection.md`` selects ``Ruicheng/moge-2-vitl``, MIT, run locally, with
MoGe-3 on a Linux GPU as the fallback because MoGe-3 has no macOS path. That note turned out to be
exactly right and worth restating with what was found: MoGe 3.0.0 requires ``torchvision>=0.19``,
and no torchvision wheel matching this platform exists for the current torch, so the package
installs only without its transitive dependencies. What it actually needs at run time is torch,
numpy, opencv and ``utils3d_moge``, and the last of those is a different package from the
``utils3d`` on PyPI, which is an unrelated stub. Installing the PyPI one produces
``module 'utils3d' has no attribute 'pt'`` a long way from the cause.

**Torch is an optional dependency and this module is not imported by the package barrel.** An
instance with no depth model still ingests a corpus and reports the stage as not run, which is the
same arrangement the vision stage has and for the same reason: a pipeline that could not run
without a 1.3 GB checkpoint is one that does not run.

**Three things measured here rather than assumed:**

*   **Metric scale is read off the checkpoint.** MoGe-2 applies a ``metric_scale`` when the model
    carries a ``scale_head``, so ``metric`` is ``hasattr(model, 'scale_head')`` rather than a
    constant keyed off the model name. A variant without one produces shape up to an unknown
    factor, the island built from it is not metric, and a spatial question over it refuses instead
    of estimating.
*   **fp16 is off on MPS.** ``infer(use_fp16=True)`` is the default and raises
    ``Input type (c10::Half) and bias type (float) should be the same`` on Metal. Verified by
    running it.
*   **The image is downscaled before inference, not after.** MoGe returns a point per input pixel,
    so a 1600x1200 photograph yields 1.9M points and a 34 MB file. The stage's ``max_edge_px``
    bounds the input, which bounds the output, the cost and the storage in one place.
