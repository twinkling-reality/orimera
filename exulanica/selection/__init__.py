"""One Selection primitive, and the path from a question to an answer that cites its evidence.

ADR-0005: "There is one Selection primitive. Every surface is an entry point that produces one,
and nothing else in the system knows where a Selection came from." The Companion, the World
Index, the Atlas Map and direct interaction all build a :class:`~exulanica.selection.plan.
SelectionPlan`, and it goes through the same validation and the same executor whichever built it.

Five modules, and the order is the pipeline:

*   :mod:`exulanica.selection.plan` is what may be asked. A closed vocabulary with one free-text
    field, and no way to express a table, a column, an operator or a workspace.
*   :mod:`exulanica.selection.validation` is what may be run. It only ever rejects, and the type
    it returns is the only thing the executor accepts.
*   :mod:`exulanica.selection.executor` is what runs. No model, parameterized SQL, a read-only
    transaction with a statement timeout.
*   :mod:`exulanica.selection.packet` is what a model may see: at most 24 items with per-request
    citation tokens, and the exact numbers an answer is allowed to contain.
*   :mod:`exulanica.selection.answer` is what a model may say, and the validator that refuses the
    rest. A correct, cited answer exists even when the model complies with nothing.

:mod:`exulanica.selection.question` sequences them and owns the two model calls.
