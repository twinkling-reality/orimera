"""The Selection plan: a filled-in form, not a query.

ADR-0005 makes one Selection primitive reachable from four equal entry points, and
``architecture-overview.md`` section 5.1 fixes what the model is allowed to emit:

    "The model emits a **closed-vocabulary JSON QueryPlan**: a fixed intent enum, resolved
    entity ids only, no table names, no column names, no operator names, no workspace id. A
    fixed compiler turns the plan into parameterized SQL with **zero string interpolation of
    model output**. Free text exists in exactly one field, the semantic query string, and
    becomes a bound parameter."

The rejected alternative was model-generated SQL behind a parser and an allowlist, and the
reason it was rejected is worth restating because it is the whole design: sanitising generated
SQL is a containment problem, and a form has no expressive surface left to sanitise. Nothing in
this module can express a table, a column, an operator or a join. There is no field a
sufficiently clever string could escape from, because there is no field whose contents reach
SQL as anything but a bound parameter.

Two consequences that look like omissions and are not:

*   **No workspace id.** Authorization comes from the session and only from the session
    (section 5.2 stage 3). A plan that could name a workspace would be a plan that could name
    somebody else's.
*   **No sort order, no offset, no aggregate.** Every one of those is a place where a caller
    could ask the database to do work proportional to something they chose. Ordering is fixed
    per intent and stated there.

The Companion is not privileged: it emits this, the World Index emits this, and the Atlas emits
this. Nothing downstream can tell which surface produced a plan, which is what stops the
conversational path expressing a filter the interface cannot.

    ``evaluation-methodology.md`` M6 is the one with tests attached, and it is explicit:

        "``ANY`` means at least one named entity present within the scope. ``ALL`` means every
        named entity present within the scope, **not necessarily in the same photograph**. Scope
        is the memory region. The stricter reading (``ALL`` in a single photograph) is a
        separate, explicitly named filter, ``TOGETHER``. All three are documented in the schema
        and all three are tested."

    ADR-0005 and ``interaction-model.md`` section 7 say something different with two names:
    "ANY or ALL. ALL requires a shared evidence window, not merely co-presence in one capture."
    Read as a two-valued vocabulary those conflict, because M6 makes ALL the looser of the two
    and the ADR makes it the stricter.

    Read as three, they reconcile exactly, and that is what is implemented:

    *   ``ANY`` and ``ALL`` take M6's meanings, including M6's trap (c), which requires that
        TOGETHER return empty for a pair present in the same region but never in the same
        photograph while ALL returns the region.
    *   ``TOGETHER`` is the ADR's strict filter, and "shared evidence window" is what
        distinguishes it from mere co-presence: the occurrences' ``presence`` multiranges must
        overlap inside one capture, not merely both occur somewhere in it. For a photograph
        every presence interval is the degenerate ``[0, 1)``, so the two coincide; for video
        they are different questions, and "these two were together" is the one the product is
        about. Implementing the general form now means the video path needs no second one.

    **The scope of ALL is the Selection's own other dimensions**, and that is a decision this
    code makes rather than one the documents make. M6 says "scope is the memory region", and
    ADR-0005 records that whether a region is one capture or a place-on-a-trip cluster is OPEN
    until the corpus has been measured. Scoping ALL to "the captures matching everything else in
    this plan" is well defined today, satisfies M6's trap (a), and needs no answer to the open
    question.
