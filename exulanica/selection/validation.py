"""Server-side validation, fail-closed, in the order ``architecture-overview.md`` 5.2 fixes.

Six stages, "each of which can only reject":

1. Structural schema validation.
2. Reference resolution. "Nonexistent ids and ids belonging to another tenant return the
   identical ``unknown_reference`` code, so the surface is not an existence oracle."
3. Authorization derived from the session only, never from anything in the plan.
4. Cost bounds.
5. Compilation to parameterized SQL.
6. Execution in a read-only transaction with a ``statement_timeout``.

Stages 1 to 4 live here. Stages 5 and 6 live in :mod:`exulanica.selection.executor`, and the seam
between them is the whole point of this module: :class:`ValidatedPlan` is the only thing the
executor accepts, and this module is the only thing that constructs one. A caller who wants to
run an unvalidated plan has no type they can pass.

**Why stage 2 is a real database round trip and not a filter.** Row-level security already makes
another workspace's entity invisible, so a plan naming one would simply match nothing and return
an empty result. That is not good enough: an empty result and a rejection are distinguishable by
the caller, and "your filter matched nothing" versus "that id is not yours" is the difference
between a private database and an oracle that confirms whether an id exists. Both cases resolve
to the same count of visible ids and therefore the same rejection.

**What is deliberately not here.** There is no repair, no coercion, no defaulting of a field the
caller got wrong. Section 5.2 permits "exactly one model repair attempt, then a deterministic
clarifying question", and that retry belongs to the caller that owns the model, not to the
validator: a validator that fixed its input would be deciding what the user meant.
