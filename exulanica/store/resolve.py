"""Resolving an evidence address back to the original bytes.

This is the closing half of the contract. An address is worth having only if it opens, and it
must open against **original media**, never against a rendition, a thumbnail or any other
derivative. The rendition exists so a model can look at something small; it is not what a
citation resolves to, and there is no function in this module that returns one.

It lives beside the store rather than beside the ingest pipeline because the readers are not
the ingest path. The Selection executor builds citation packets out of these addresses and the
evidence endpoint serves the bytes; neither of those is ingestion, and a read path that had to
import the writer to open a citation would be the wrong way round.

``address_from_span_row`` exists to prove the round trip: a span read back out of the database
reconstructs an address whose digest equals the digest that was stored. If that ever stops
being true, every citation token in every archived answer has silently stopped verifying, and
this is the cheapest place to find out.
