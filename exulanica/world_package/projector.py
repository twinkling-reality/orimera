    # **The scene predicate is asked ONCE, here, and every other query is filtered by its
    # answer.** ADR-0009 D9 gives a fact about N photographs a subject, and the reduction over
    # that subject INVERTS: a derivative of one photograph survives while any live capture holds
    # its bytes, and a scene artifact is withdrawn by the deletion of ONE of its members, because
    # a receipt over eight photographs is not a claim about the seven that are left.
    #
    # Asking it once is not tidiness, it is what makes the package internally consistent.
    # Repeatable read fixes which ROWS this transaction sees, so two calls agree about the
    # tombstone table. It does not fix the CLOCK: `tombstone_blocks_scene` reaches
    # `tombstone_blocks_capture`, which filters `t.effective_at <= clock_timestamp()`, and
    # `clock_timestamp()` advances between statements. A tombstone committed before the snapshot
    # with an `effective_at` falling between two calls would be invisible to the first and
    # visible to the second, and the package would then describe a receipt whose subject it had
    # already dropped. Nothing in this repository writes a future `effective_at`, so it is
    # unreachable today and it is designed out rather than commented around.
    #
    # The workspace filter is explicit rather than left to row-level security, which is what the
    # older queries in this function rely on. Both are correct in production; only this one is
    # falsifiable by a test, because the harness connects as the schema owner and a superuser
    # bypasses row-level security entirely, so no test here can see a missing predicate.
    # A production worker prepares scene and artifact rows before flushing object bytes, then
    # publishes its assertion and succeeded job in a second transaction. A package must not
    # expose that retryable middle state. Scenes created before the job system have no job row
    # and remain exportable; a job-backed scene enters the package only after one job succeeds.
