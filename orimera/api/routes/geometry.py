"""Reconstructed geometry: the route by which a derivative reaches a renderer.

**This is not the evidence route and it must never be mistaken for one.** Invariant 2 is that
reconstruction is never evidence: an ``evidence_span`` references ``blob``, artifacts do not live
there, and a point map has nothing a citation could point at. The two routes are separate
prefixes served by separate modules over separate tables for that reason, and
``tests/test_reconstruction_is_not_evidence.py`` asserts the separation from four directions.
What ``/evidence`` serves is what a historical claim resolves to. What this serves is a picture of
a place, whose quality "never participates in the truth guarantee".

Two routes, and the pairing is the whole design.

``GET /geometry`` is the **descriptor list**: which captures have geometry, what container it is
in, how many bytes it is, and the SHA-256 the bytes must hash to. ``GET /geometry/{artifact_id}``
is the bytes. ADR-0009 D10 requires "bytes in hand, a bearer in the header, and the content hash
verified against the descriptor that named it", and it is the descriptor that makes the third
clause possible: bytes fetched from a URL nobody vouched for are bytes a decoder has to trust.

**The ETag is a cache validator and is not what makes the bytes trustworthy.** It happens to be
the same SHA-256, because a content-addressed store has nothing better to offer as a strong
validator. A client that verified against it would be checking the response against itself. The
descriptor is what named the digest before the transfer began, and the client checks against
that; ``web/packages/app/src/geometry-api.ts`` says the same thing from the other side.

**Nothing is stored.** ``Cache-Control: no-store`` rather than the evidence route's
``private, max-age=3600``. A derivative in a browser's on-disk cache is a copy of the corpus in a
place the deletion path cannot reach, and this is the one route that hands one out.

**No range requests, deliberately, and this is the one byte route in this API that refuses one.**
The evidence route supports them because a citation deep link should not have to transfer a whole
photograph to show the top of it. Here the client cannot verify a fragment against a digest of
the whole, so a range would hand back exactly the bytes it has no way to check. A point map is a
few megabytes, which is what makes refusing affordable.

**Deletion reaches this route before the purger does.** A tombstone is authoritative from the
moment it commits and the bytes catch up later, so the read asks the database's own guard rather
than ``artifact.purged_at`` alone, and answers **410 Gone** rather than 404 for something the
user deleted. A client holding a descriptor from before a deletion learns that the region's
geometry is gone rather than that it was never there.
