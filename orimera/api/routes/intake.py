"""``POST /intake``: upload photographs, and watch them arrive.

**The queue between this route and the worker holds capture ids and never bytes.** That is the
one decision this file exists to keep, and :mod:`orimera.ingest.derivative_queue` carries the
argument for it: an evidence address is a content hash of the original bytes, and the deletion
cascade reaches the rows under the tombstone guards and the objects in the content-addressed
store, and nothing else. Bytes staged anywhere in between are outside both, a tombstone written
while they sit there cascades to neither, and every test of the cascade still passes because
they look at the database and at the store.

So the staging window collapses to one request. The **intake stage runs here, synchronously**:
a hash, an EXIF read, an orientation transform and a handful of rows, tens of milliseconds on an
ordinary photograph. What is expensive is the vision stage, which is a model call, and it runs
in the worker from a capture id. The pipeline this route builds has **no vision model and no
depth model**, which is not a configuration choice: it is what makes "no model call happens in a
request thread" structural rather than a thing to be careful about.

**The store write still lands after the transaction that ran the tombstone guard commits.** The
obvious way to put uploaded bytes somewhere guarded is to write them to the store on arrival,
and that regresses the fix for defect 4 exactly: the rows of a refused import roll back and the
purged bytes stay on disk. Nothing here writes to the store; ``committed_writes`` does, after.

**202 and not 201.** The photographs are in the library when this returns and the rest of their
processing is not. ``batch_id`` is what the formation stream is addressed by, so the client that
caused the work is the client that watches it.

The eight checks, in the order a part meets them:

1.  the bearer token names a workspace, or the request never reaches this function;
2.  the request carries at most :data:`MAX_PARTS` parts;
3.  the part's name ends in a suffix this pipeline reads;
4.  the part is at most :data:`MAX_PART_BYTES`;
5.  the part is not empty;
6.  the bytes are an image of a format Pillow identifies, from the header alone;
7.  the frame is inside the pixel budget, from the same header, so a decompression bomb is
    refused for the price of parsing a header and the refusal states the pixel count;
8.  the content hash is not under a tombstone, which the pipeline asks before it writes anything
    anywhere, and which the database asks again inside the writing transaction.

**What is bounded here and what is not.** Checks 3 to 5 bound what reaches the store and the
database, which is what they are for. They do not bound the temporary file a multipart parser
has already written by the time this function runs: the body is received and parsed before any
route sees it. :mod:`orimera.api.body_limit` refuses an over-large declared body ahead of that,
and a request that declares no length at all is a reverse proxy's to bound.
