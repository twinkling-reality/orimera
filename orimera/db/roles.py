"""The runtime role, and the privileges that make row-level security mean anything.

Migration 0001 says, in the comment above its RLS section: "The query executor connects as a
role that owns nothing and does not hold BYPASSRLS. An executor connecting as the table owner
makes every policy here silently inert, which is the failure this comment exists to prevent."

That role did not exist. Everything, including the whole test suite, connected as the database
owner, who on a default installation is also a superuser, and a superuser bypasses row-level
security entirely. Every policy in the schema was inert and the tests that appeared to prove
workspace isolation were proving the trigger guards instead, which fire for superusers too. The
distinction is not academic: the trigger guards refuse a WRITE that names the wrong workspace,
while RLS is what stops a READ of another workspace's rows, and nothing was testing the second.

So this module creates the role and grants it exactly what it needs:

*   **No DELETE anywhere.** Deletion in this system is a tombstone plus a purge job plus the
    separately authorised purger in :mod:`orimera.store.base`. A runtime role that can DELETE
    can erase the record of what it erased.
*   **SELECT only on ``predicate``.** This is defect R3. ``allows_kind`` is what stops a model
    filing a name, and ``writes_a_name`` is what stops a new vocabulary row escaping the rule
    by being spelled differently. A runtime role that can UPDATE that table can disarm both,
    and the vocabulary is global rather than workspace-scoped, so one workspace could disarm it
    for every workspace. It is a lookup table the application reads and an administrator edits.
*   **SELECT only on ``schema_migrations``.** The application verifies its schema at boot; it
    does not record migrations.
*   **SELECT only on the world style and interaction registries.** Profile and capability
    registration is a reviewed migration/code change. A runtime process may propose registered
    values; it cannot register its own renderer or interaction vocabulary.
*   **No ownership and no BYPASSRLS**, which is the whole point.

Every statement here is built with :mod:`psycopg.sql` rather than an f-string. Role names,
schema names and passwords all reach DDL, and DDL takes no bound parameters, so the choice is
between a composer that quotes correctly and a hand-rolled validator that has to be right.

    **The privilege is a cross-workspace READ, and it is here because the alternative is silent
    cross-tenant data loss.** ``blob`` is not workspace-scoped: two workspaces that ingest the
    same photograph share one row and one object in the store, and migration 0001 says so and
    names reference counting as the eventual fix. The purger has to ask "does anything still hold
    these exact bytes" before it destroys them, and under row-level security a session scoped to
    one workspace cannot see another's captures. Measured, as the runtime role, on a probe
    database: workspace A deletes its capture, workspace B still holds a live capture of the same
    bytes, and ``purge_releases_bytes`` answers **true**. Destroying them there breaks B's
    citations and nothing reports it.

    So this role gets a permissive ``for select using (true)`` policy on ``capture`` and
    ``artifact``, and gets it narrowly:

    *   **SELECT only.** Its UPDATE is still filtered by ``ws_isolation``, so it may mark rows
        purged only in the workspace it is scoped to. It reads across tenants and writes within
        one, which is the asymmetry the question actually needs.
    *   **Column by column.** A policy cannot restrict columns; a grant can. It is given the
        identifiers, the hashes and the deletion markers, and not ``device_id``, not
        ``started_at``, and not an artifact's ``idempotency_key``.
    *   **No DELETE anywhere, on any table.** Erasure of bytes runs through
        ``orimera.store.privileged_purger``, which cannot be constructed without naming the
        tombstone that authorises it. Erasure of rows is not something this system does.
    *   **And its UPDATE on the queue and the tombstone is column by column too.** It was not,
        and a review measured what a full-table grant bought: this role could push a tombstone's
        ``effective_at`` a year out, which reopens the leak 0011 closed, and could set
        ``purge_completed_at`` over a photograph still on disk. Neither table carries an UPDATE
        trigger, so the grant was the only thing standing there.

    Idempotent, like :func:`provision_runtime_role`, and safe to call at every deployment.

    ``role`` is a parameter for the same reason it is one there: **a role is a CLUSTER object**,
    so a test suite that provisioned the deployment's own role names would be reaching outside
    every database-scoped guard the harness has, and would leave the developer's live roles
    carrying whatever password the last test run chose. The tests provision suffixed names.
