"""One claimed purge job, and the three ways it can end.

The queue is filled by a trigger in the tombstone's own transaction, not by this module and not
by any caller: migration 0013 section 5 says why. What is here is the reading half.

**Nothing here is terminal except ``done``, and that took two corrections to get right.**

``skipped`` was the first: a job whose bytes something else still holds has not failed and is not
done, and terminal ``skipped`` set ``tombstone.purge_completed_at`` while the photograph was
still on disk, because the unique constraint refused a second row for the same target and the
completion check ignored it.

``failed`` was the second, and it was the same defect left standing one column over. Measured
with a store whose delete raised once, a transient outage: two jobs went to ``failed``, three
later passes with a healthy store did nothing at all, the bytes a user deleted stayed on disk for
ever, the tombstone never completed, and re-enqueueing the same target raised `UniqueViolation`.
The only recovery was writing a second tombstone for the same capture, which no interface offers.
It is now re-claimable, bounded by :data:`MAX_ATTEMPTS` so a permanently broken target reports
rather than spins.

**And ``running`` is reclaimed here, on a timestamp, which the derivative queue may not do.**
Both queues reclaim now; the shapes differ and the difference is what a re-run costs. Every step
here is idempotent and cheap: the advisory lock serialises two purgers on one object, ``purge``
returns False when the object is already absent, ``mark_purged`` is a conditional UPDATE, and the
predicate is re-asked before anything is destroyed. So a second worker taking a row a live purger
is still working on does the safe thing by construction, and ``attempted_at`` alone is a good
enough signal. A derivative job's expensive step is a paid model call with a per-request nonce
and no caching, so a reclaim of a LIVE claimant there costs money and can produce two terminal
events for one batch; that queue therefore carries a lease the claimant renews and a token every
write of its own is conditional on. Same defect, two costs, two shapes, and
:mod:`orimera.ingest.derivative_queue` is where the other one is explained.

What a stranded row leaves without this is worse than "work not done": measured, a crash between
the store unlink and the COMMIT leaves the bytes gone, the ``blob`` row saying they are live, and
a ``storage_key`` pointing at an object that is not there, which is the exact inverse of what
0001's stub design exists to produce.

#: How long a job waits before it is tried again, whether it was skipped, failed, or stranded in

#: re-examined every second, short enough that a deletion completes within an hour of the last
#: thing releasing it.
RETRY_AFTER: Final = dt.timedelta(minutes=15)

#: How many times a job may be CLAIMED before it stops being re-claimed. Claimed, not failed, and
#: the distinction is the correction: :func:`claim_purge` increments ``attempts`` on every claim
#: including one that ends ``skipped``, and a skipped job's next attempt is NOT identical to its
#: last. It was deferred because another live capture, possibly in another workspace, still holds
#: those exact bytes, and that is a fact about the world which changes when that capture is
#: deleted. So the bound is on how many times this queue will look at a job, not on how many
#: times a target has broken.
#:
#: **The comment was corrected and the behaviour was left, which is the choice worth stating.**
#: Not charging a deferral would mean a blob some other workspace keeps for ever is re-examined
#: every fifteen minutes for ever, which is the spin this bound exists to stop. Charging it means
#: a long-held blob can use its eight looks and stop being examined while its tombstone is still
#: incomplete, and the reason that is acceptable is that it is VISIBLE:
#: :func:`orimera.deletion.worker._exhausted` counts every non-``done`` job at the bound,
#: deferrals included, and `orimera-purge` prints "job(s) have used every attempt and will not be
#: retried". A bound that is reported is a decision; the same bound, unreported, would be the

#: handing a uuid to `BlobId.from_hex`: measured, that fails the job, and with the retry bound
#: above it would burn its attempts and leave the tombstone permanently incomplete.
