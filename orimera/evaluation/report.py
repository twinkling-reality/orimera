"""Turning results into a report, with section 3's rules enforced by the code that writes it.

Nine rules, and the ones that can be mechanical are mechanical here rather than in a reviewer's
head. What is enforced: every number carries n and, where an interval is meaningful, an interval
(rule 1, in ``counts.render``); the corpus tag travels with every number (rule 2); what the corpus
does not cover is printed next to the results (rule 3 of 3.1 and section 1.7); failures are named
with evidence (rule 4, in ``NamedCase``); the two acceptance tables are two headings (rule 5);
modality is disclosed (rule 7); and the banned vocabulary is scanned (rule 9).

The banned-word scan runs over THIS REPORT and nowhere else, unconditionally. An earlier design
scanned the whole documentation set, found 85 hits it could not adjudicate, and put the scan
behind a flag. A check nobody turns on is not a check. Scoped to the generated report it is
decidable, because a report is the one artefact whose every word this code wrote.

WITH ONE EXEMPTION, found by the scan refusing its own first report. Section 6's "licenses" and
"does not license" cells are quoted verbatim, and two of them use words rule 9 bans: M9's cell
says "any private entity" and M10's says "anonymous asset URLs are protected. They are not."
Rule 9 bans those words as CAPABILITY CLAIMS, and the "does not license" column is the
anti-claim column: scanning it would forbid the report from saying that something is NOT
guaranteed, which inverts the rule it is enforcing. So the quoted cells are marked as quoted and
excluded, and the scan covers every word this harness composes. The exemption is auditable
because ``tests/test_evaluation.py`` pins the quoted text to section 6 verbatim, so nothing can
be smuggled through the exemption without failing that.
