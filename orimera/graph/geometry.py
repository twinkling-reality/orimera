"""What geometry a region has, and the bytes of it. The read behind the delivery route.

ADR-0009 D10: "There is no production path by which any point map reaches the renderer: no route
serves artifact bytes, and the only loader in the workspace is a development preview... The
delivery route is the first item of work, before any of the above, and it carries the
authentication and digest rules that the residency design already assumes: bytes in hand, a
bearer in the header, and the content hash verified against the descriptor that named it."

This module is the read half of that. Seven decisions in it are load bearing.

**This list holds point maps and nothing above them, and that is a property of its shape rather
than of its filter.** The descriptor query inner-joins ``capture`` on ``source_blob_sha256``,
which is the identity scheme ADR-0009 D9 says a pose receipt, a splat and a placement record
have no home in: they are "facts about N photographs" and get a scene identity with an explicit
many-to-many source relation. Adding a kind to this query would return zero rows for such an
artifact, or one row keyed to whichever member's blob happened to land in the column, which would
present a corridor as one photograph's geometry. The route generalises by carrying ``kind`` on
the wire; **the read does not generalise, and the scene-artifact half is a second read against a
relation that does not exist yet.**

**A descriptor is keyed by CAPTURE, never by island.** ``orimera.graph``'s own docstring says why:
"Islands are not a server concept... A server that shipped an island id would be settling that
question by accident." ADR-0005 leaves it open, the client already maps captures to islands
through an injectable function, and geometry has to arrive on the same key the graph does or the
two would disagree about which region a shell belongs to.

**A descriptor carries no rung.** The recorded rung claim already reaches the client on the graph
payload, per scene group and worst-first, which is the granularity a region is drawn at. ADR-0009
D11's complaint is that a second, divergent copy of the rung vocabulary exists in the frontend;
answering it with a second copy on the wire would be the same mistake one layer down. What a
descriptor says is what geometry exists and how to check the bytes, and nothing about how good
it is.

**Liveness is asked of the database's own guard, not re-implemented here.**
``tombstone_blocks_capture`` is the predicate migration 0001's ``before insert`` triggers call on
``occurrence``, so what this refuses to serve is a rule that exists once and in SQL. It covers
workspace, capture and interval scope. It does **not** cover entity scope, and that is correct
rather than an omission: deleting a person is not deleting the photograph, which
``domain-and-evidence-model.md`` section 6.4 states as a consequence that "must not be softened".
What that section promises for entity scope and does not do is recorded there under CORRECTED,
and it is a gap in the cascade rather than in this read.

**Not ``tombstone_blocks_derivative``, and the difference is the interval branch.** That
predicate is what refuses to WRITE a derivative, and migration 0011 deliberately leaves the
interval scope out of it, "because a redaction removes a moment and not a photograph": the
designed behaviour is a derivative marked ``needs_repair`` and regenerated from the surviving
intervals. A still photograph has no surviving interval. Section 1.5 gives every image the
interval ``[0, 1)``, so an interval tombstone over an image covers the whole frame, and a point
map of it is a derivative of nothing but redacted content. Reading is therefore stricter than
writing here, on purpose. **The day a derivative covers part of a track rather than all of one,
this predicate is the wrong one** and the right one is a question about the spans the artifact
actually drew from, which nothing records yet.

**``artifact.purged_at`` is not sufficient on its own and is checked anyway.** A tombstone is
authoritative the moment it commits and the bytes catch up later, so between the two there is a
window in which the artifact row is unpurged and the capture is deleted. Serving in that window
would be serving something the user has already deleted. Both are therefore checked, and the
tombstone is checked first because it is the one that is true earlier.

**The store is passed in.** ``orimera.graph`` sits above ``orimera.store`` in the layering and
below ``orimera.api``, and the API owns which store an instance is wired to. Handing the store to
the function rather than letting the module reach for one is the same arrangement
``WorldStyleRepository.source_media`` uses, and for the same reason: a read module that could
resolve its own bytes is a read module that could resolve somebody else's.
