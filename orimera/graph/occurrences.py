    Suppressed proposals are returned rather than filtered out, with the flag set. The client

    "why is it not asking me about this" unanswerable.

    ``new_modality`` is what this proposal carries that the user has not already refused for the
    pair, and it is what lets an interface say why it is asking again rather than appearing to
    nag. It is NULL when nothing about the pair was refused before, which is the ordinary case
    and not an absent value.

    ``suppressed_by_rejection`` is DERIVED here rather than read off ``outcome``, for the same
    reason ``pending_match_proposal`` exists. ``outcome`` records what the producer decided when
    it wrote the row, and the emit key is deliberately keyed on the question rather than on the
    answer, so a proposal the user rejects afterwards keeps ``outcome = 'surfaced'`` forever: the
    next pass recomputes the same key and ``on conflict do nothing`` declines to rewrite it.
    Reading the column would then show a refused proposal as a live one. Whether it is suppressed
    is a fact about the user's decisions, so it is answered from those.
