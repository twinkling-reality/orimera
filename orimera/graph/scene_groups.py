"""The time-and-position clustering ingest computed, and the rung each capture earned.

Together because a group's rung is the WORST any of its members earned, so the two reads are one
question asked at two granularities. Worst rather than best because a region is navigable at the
level of its weakest part, which is the reduction `payload.py` documents and `max` implements:
the rungs run 1 for a full splat to 4 for no geometry, so the largest number is the poorest
result. Neither is an island: ADR-0005 leaves that open until the corpus has been measured, and a
server that shipped an island id would settle it by accident.

    Read from ``assertion`` rather than from a column, because the rung is not a property of the
    photograph: it is what a particular model at a particular version managed to place from it,
    and a different checkpoint gives a different answer over the same bytes. Migration 0005 seeds
    the predicate with ``allows_kind = {inference}`` alone, so the database refuses a rung filed
    as a capture-supported fact whatever the pipeline later tries.

    Active rows only, NEWEST FIRST, and the ordering is load bearing rather than tidy.
    ``predicate.functional`` is documented in migration 0001 as "at most one active object per
    subject" and is enforced by nothing: no constraint, no index and no trigger reads the column.
    That is defect R16. So a capture reconstructed twice can carry two active rungs, and an
    unordered read would report whichever row the planner happened to return. Taking the newest
    per capture means the rung on screen is the most recent one whatever the vocabulary does or
    does not enforce, and the day it is enforced this query is unchanged.

    A superseded rung is what a previous run believed and stays readable in the history;
    presenting it as current would be presenting a stale reconstruction as the one on screen.
