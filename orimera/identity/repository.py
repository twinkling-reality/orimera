"""Which workspace is this, on which connection, and which vocabulary answers the question?

The transactional operations live in :mod:`orimera.identity.decisions`. This is rows: it knows how
an entity, a link, a rejection and an event are stored, and it knows nothing about what sequence
of them constitutes a merge.

This module holds three things of its own, and this class has no query in it. Every read and
write lives in the module named for the question its table answers, and the repository exposes
each as an attribute, so a call site says which table group it is touching before it says what it
is doing:

*   :mod:`orimera.identity.occurrences` as ``occurrences``: which detection is this, and which
    detections is this person confirmed to be?
*   :mod:`orimera.identity.entities` as ``entities``: what is one person record, and which record
    represents it now?
*   :mod:`orimera.identity.links` as ``links``: what has been decided about this detection, in
    what state, and by whom?
*   :mod:`orimera.identity.rejections` as ``rejections``: has this pair, on this basis, already
    been refused, and what is new about the one being asked now?
*   :mod:`orimera.identity.never_same` as ``never_same``: were these two records pulled apart by a
    person, so that a merge of them must be refused?
*   :mod:`orimera.identity.proposals` as ``proposals``: what did the producer ask, and which of
    those questions is still waiting for an answer?
*   :mod:`orimera.identity.events` as ``events``: what was decided, in what order, and does the
    record say enough to undo it?
*   :mod:`orimera.identity.recomputation` as ``recomputation``: what must be recomputed because of
    this decision?

**The collaborators take the repository rather than a connection and a workspace id.** That is
what keeps the scoping structural rather than remembered. ``Entities(connection, workspace)`` is
not a constructible thing; ``Entities(repository)`` is, and the repository is the only object in
this package that calls :func:`orimera.db.session.set_workspace`.
