"""The queue between the two halves of an ingest. It holds capture ids and never bytes.

**Why that is the whole design.** An upload has to put the photograph somewhere before the
pipeline can hash it, and there is nowhere safe to put it. An evidence address is a content hash
of the original bytes, a track key and a time interval; the bytes behind one live in the
content-addressed store, and the deletion cascade reaches exactly two things, the rows under the
nine tombstone guards and the objects in that store. Bytes staged anywhere else, a spool
directory or a queue payload or a scratch prefix, are reachable by neither. A tombstone written
while a file sits there finds nothing to cascade to, and every test of the cascade still passes,
because they look at the database and at the store. That is a deletion hole the suite is
structurally blind to, which is why the resolution is a shape rather than a sweep.

So the request thread runs the intake stage to completion, the bytes land in the store through
``committed_writes`` after the transaction that ran the tombstone guard commits, and what is
queued is the identifier of the capture that now owns them.

**A queued capture that is deleted before the worker runs is the ordinary path, not a hole.**
Migration 0011 refuses a derivative of tombstoned bytes, so the artifact row is refused and,
because the store write is deferred past the commit, the bytes are refused with it. The run is
cancelled rather than failed, and the orphan bytes left behind are the orphans any cancelled
ingest produces, in the store, which is the one place deletion reaches.

**A claim is a lease, and a lease is not a timestamp.** A worker that died leaves its row in
``running`` where no ``state = 'queued'`` predicate can see it, which is what R20 recorded. The
recovery is not "reclaim anything claimed a while ago": measured, a worker eight captures into a
job it is actively working on is indistinguishable from a dead one by ``claimed_at``, and every
reclaim that mistake produces pays for a model call a second time. So a claimant is believed
until ``lease_expires_at``, pushes that forward with :func:`heartbeat` between captures, and
:func:`claim` takes a ``running`` row only once the claimant has stopped saying anything.

**The lease is a heuristic and :data:`QueuedDerivatives.claim_token` is what makes a wrong one
cheap.** Nothing bounds the gap between two beats exactly: the model call has a computable
budget, the rendition and ``run_continuity`` in the same gap have none. Every write a claimant
makes to its own row therefore carries the token its claim issued, and a reclaim rotates it. A
worker whose lease was taken finds out at its next heartbeat and withdraws. Without that, measured
with two real processes: the reclaiming worker closed the batch `succeeded` at 17:58:13.896531 and
the original rewrote the same batch as `failed` with a fresh `ended_at` at 17:58:18.428698, and the
second terminal event arrived after the client's stream had already ended on the first.

**Four verbs, and each is a different fact about one lease.** :func:`claim` takes the next job,
whether it was queued or was left running by a claimant that stopped saying anything.
:func:`heartbeat` says the claimant is still here, and answers False rather than raising when it
is not. :func:`finish` closes a job the caller still holds. :func:`abandon` takes a job stranded
:data:`MAX_CLAIMS` times to a terminal state so the batch watching it can be closed. Nothing here
exposes the two columns, because a caller reading ``lease_expires_at`` would be deciding for
itself what an expired one means.

#: reaches its terminal event after about 3 x 720 = 2160 seconds; queued work can make it later.
