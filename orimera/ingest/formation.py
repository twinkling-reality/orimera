"""The provenance ledger, projected into the phases the interface names.

``interaction-model.md`` 8.1 is the rule this module exists to keep: "Every visual formation
state is paired with a factual label naming the REAL pipeline stage and the REAL unit of
progress. There is no synthetic progress bar and no invented percentage." So every number below
is counted from ``pipeline_event`` rows that a stage actually wrote, and a number that cannot be
counted is absent rather than estimated.

**The two vocabularies are not the same and this is where they meet.** The ledger records the
stages this pipeline has: ``intake``, ``rendition``, ``vision``, ``scene_group``. The interface
names the stages a person can see: media extraction, entity indexing, continuity search. The
mapping is one to many in one direction and empty in the other, and both halves are honest:

*   ``intake`` and ``rendition`` are the two halves of one visible stage. A visitor does not have
    a concept of a rendition and would not be better off with one.
*   ``camera_recovery`` and ``reconstruction`` are visible stages that NOTHING PRODUCES. They
    belong to the offline reconstruction job, which does not run. They are absent from the stream
    rather than emitted as instantly complete, because a stage reported as done that never ran is
    the exact shape of the dishonesty this file is written against.

**Counters are a fold, not a query per event.** ``done`` at any point in the stream is the number
of runs that had finished that phase by that point, computed by walking the events in order. That
makes a resumed stream report the same numbers as an uninterrupted one, which a per-event
``count(*)`` would not: a client that reconnected would see history recomputed against the
present and watch a counter jump backwards or forwards for no reason a user could explain.

**Detections are a snapshot and say so.** How many people, objects and places have been found is
not derivable from the ledger, because an occurrence is not a ledger event. It is counted once
per projection and attached to the last event of that projection only. The client treats
detections as accumulating and carries the last value forward, so a stream of events that mostly
do not carry one is the normal case rather than a gap.
