"""The photograph ingest pipeline: a file on disk to persisted, provenance-tracked observations.

Four stages, each one idempotent by construction and each one a module in ``stages/``:

    intake     hash the bytes, read EXIF, normalise orientation, register the capture, the
               single-sample img track, the wall-clock anchor and the whole-image span, and
               emit the capture-supported assertions
    rendition  a 768 px display-space JPEG with no EXIF, the only pixels a model ever sees
    vision     one structured call, producing model inferences that each carry an evidence
               address and are filed as inference and never as anything else
    depth      one optional point-map prediction, producing a derived reconstruction artifact

Scene grouping runs once over the corpus after these per-capture stages, from the worker or
directory command, and produces proposals rather than pretending to be a fifth capture stage.

This module sequences them and owns the two things they share: the transaction whose object
store writes land after it commits, and the artifact writer. What a stage is allowed to reach
for is ``stages.writes.StageWrites``, which this class satisfies; it holds several other things
a stage has no business touching, and the Protocol is where that line is drawn.

Re-running is free. Every derivative is keyed by ``(source blob, stage, stage version, params,
input digest, run-time binding)``, so a second run over the same directory resolves each stage
from its artifact row and makes **zero** model calls. That is a cost control first and a
correctness control second: without it, "re-run everything" means paying for every vision call
again, every time. It cuts the other way too, and has to: the vision stage's params carry the
prompt's own digest and its binding carries the resolved model identifier, so editing the
prompt or swapping the model does reprocess, which is the failure this key is most likely to
hide.

Nothing reaches the object store until the tombstone guard has passed and the transaction that
passed it has committed. The store is not in the transaction, so a byte written early is a byte
a rollback cannot take back, and for purged content that means resurrection.

The epistemic split is enforced at the data layer, not by care here. ``predicate.allows_kind``
refuses a caption filed as a capture-supported fact and refuses any name at all from a model.
