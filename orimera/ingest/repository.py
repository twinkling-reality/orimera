"""The vocabulary the ingest path speaks to the database.

This class used to be the vocabulary *and* the SQL: 730 lines, every statement the photograph
path sends to the spine. The statements now live in :mod:`orimera.ingest.spine`, one module per
table's worth of queries, and what is left here is the sentence each stage says. That division
is the whole of the change, and it is worth saying which half is which:

*   **A method here is a thing the ingest path does.** ``lock_stored_object``,
    ``refuse_ingest_if_tombstoned``, ``upsert_span``. The stages read as prose because these
    names are prose, and ``orimera/ingest/stages/writes.py`` declares this class as the complete
    surface a stage may reach for. A stage never sees a
    :class:`~orimera.ingest.spine.scope.WorkspaceScope`, so that declaration stays exhaustive.
*   **A function in the spine is a table.** Which columns, which conflict clause, which guard
    the write goes through. A question about ``artifact`` is answered by opening one file.

**No caller lost its route in the move.** Every method with a call site is still here, and the
two names that went were counted first: ``span_address_columns`` and ``vision_payloads_by_blob``
had no caller anywhere in ``orimera/`` or ``tests/``, and this repository does not keep a path
for a caller that does not exist. ``count`` was renamed to ``rows_in_schema`` because it never
counted a workspace; see :mod:`orimera.ingest.spine.counts`.

What the move did **not** change, because each of these is load bearing:

*   **The tombstone guard is a trigger inside the writing transaction.**
    ``tombstone_blocks_span()`` is called by ``tg_tombstone_guard_span`` and friends on the same
    row being written, and it is VOLATILE so it takes a fresh snapshot rather than reusing the
    statement's. The application check that remains, :meth:`refuse_ingest_if_tombstoned`, is not
    a duplicate of it: it runs **before any bytes reach the object store**, which is the one
    thing a trigger cannot do, because the store is not in the transaction.
*   **Row-level security is real.** Six of the ten tables the spine writes are in migration
    0001's FORCE list, keyed on ``current_workspace()``: ``capture``, ``evidence_span``,
    ``artifact``, ``occurrence``, ``derived_artifact`` and ``tombstone``. The four that are not
    are ``stage_registry``, ``blob``, ``media_track`` and ``clock_anchor``, none of which has a
    ``workspace_id`` column, because a stage's version and a container's dimensions are facts
    about a deployment and a file rather than about one person's corpus. The docstring this
    replaced listed three of those four and quietly dropped ``stage_registry``. The connection
    must still have declared a workspace, and
    :class:`~orimera.ingest.spine.scope.WorkspaceScope` is now the only way a spine module can be
    handed one that has.
*   **``predicate.allows_kind`` is enforced by the database.** Assertions are delegated to
    :class:`~orimera.epistemics.assertions.AssertionWriter` rather than reimplemented, because
    the identity path writes the ``kind='user'`` naming assertion too and two implementations of
    "insert an assertion" would be two places for the rule to drift.
