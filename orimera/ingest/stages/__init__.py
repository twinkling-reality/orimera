"""The stage registry and the derivative identity key.

A derivative's identity is ``(source_blob_sha256, stage_key, stage_version, params_digest,
input_digest, binding_digest)``. Not the capture id, because two captures of identical bytes
should share derivatives. Not the wall clock, obviously.

``binding_digest`` covers the part of a stage's identity that is resolved at run time rather
than declared in this file: for a model-backed stage, the identifier the stage will actually
call. A stage whose ``model_role`` is set cannot have a key computed without one, so swapping
the model behind a role cannot leave the corpus keyed as though nothing changed.

This is a **cost control as much as a correctness control**, and that is why it exists on day
one rather than being added when it hurts. Re-running the pipeline after changing one stage
regenerates that stage only. Retries re-bill nothing. Duplicate photographs, which are normal
in a personal library, compute their derivatives once.

This module is the package root because the registry IS what "stages" means in general: what
the stages are, and how a derivative produced by one is identified. The four modules beside it
are the stages themselves, one per key, and they are imported by name rather than re-exported
from here, so that importing the registry does not drag a database repository in behind it.
``scene_group`` is declared here and has no module beside it: it runs over the whole corpus
once the photographs are in, from ``orimera.ingest.scenes``, rather than inside one file's run.

``version`` is bumped when **output semantics** change: a new model, a changed prompt, a
changed schema, a changed threshold. It is not bumped for a pure performance change. Every
semantic parameter is inside ``params``, so a threshold edit that someone forgets to record as
a version bump still changes the key and still forces regeneration.
