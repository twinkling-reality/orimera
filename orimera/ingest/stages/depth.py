"""Stage 4. One photograph becomes a metric point map, and the rung it earned is recorded.

**The point map is an artifact and never a blob.** Invariant 2: reconstruction is never
evidence. An ``evidence_span`` references ``blob``, artifacts do not live there, and so a point
map has nothing a citation could point at. That is structural rather than guarded, and
``tests/test_reconstruction_is_not_evidence.py`` asserts it from four directions.

**The rung is a proposal about presentation, not a claim about the world.** It is written as an
inference-class assertion on the capture, which is the only class it could honestly take: a
model looked at a photograph and reported how much of it could be placed. It supports no
historical clause and could not, because the vocabulary refuses.

With no depth model configured the compatibility summary still lists the stage as skipped, while
the durable ledger records the sharper `stage_unavailable` fact. A capture with no point map is a
rung 4 region, which is a real rung with a real experience, and the absence of an implementation
is not the same fact as a stage that failed.
