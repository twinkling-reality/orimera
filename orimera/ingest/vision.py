"""Vision extraction: the schema, the prompt, and the boundary that keeps prose out.

Everything this module produces is **model inference**. Not one field of it is a
capture-supported observation, and nothing here may be filed as one. A detection is an
inference no matter how confident it is; "capture-supported" means a property of the recording
itself, and a model looking at the recording is not that.

Three properties are structural rather than documented:

*   **Naked prose cannot reach canonical state.** The only path out of this module is a payload
    that parsed as JSON, validated against a Pydantic model, and passed range checks. A
    response the model wrote in English fails at the first step and the stage fails with it.
*   **No identity is proposed.** The schema has no field for a person's name, so there is no
    value the model could return that would become one. The system never proposes a real-world
    identity: names come only from the account holder's own annotation.
*   **A person becomes a scene-local occurrence and nothing more.** A located person is an
    occurrence with an evidence address, exactly as a located object is. It is never an entity,
    it never carries a name, and no embedding of any kind is derived from it. The line is drawn
    at the embedding deliberately: open item P-1 in ``docs/product-specification.md`` section 10
    asks when a biometric template may exist at all, and all three candidate rules in
    ``docs/privacy-consent-threat-model.md`` section 10 are rules about persisting a template.
    A bounding box saying "somebody is here" is not one, and BIPA's definition turns on a scan
    of face geometry rather than on the photograph. So detection proceeds and derivation does
    not, and the recurrence thesis gets a data path without anyone deciding P-1 by accident.

The prompt carries a per-request nonce. That is a mitigation and it is described as one: OWASP
LLM01:2025 states plainly that its mitigations are mitigations rather than a complete fix,
"because injection is inherent to how generative models process input". The real defence is
that this model has no authority worth stealing. It cannot call a tool, cannot write a name,
cannot create an entity, and its output is tagged untrusted for everything downstream.
