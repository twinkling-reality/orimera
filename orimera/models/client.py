"""The Token Factory client. Routing by role, one structured-output mechanism, one fallback rule.

Everything here exists because of something that was measured, not assumed:

*   **Routing is by role.** A caller never names a model. The manifest names models; this client
    resolves a role to a chain and walks it.
*   **Fallback fires on a 404-class error and nothing else.** A withdrawn identifier is the one
    failure a different model can fix. A 429, a 500 or a timeout is the same model having a bad
    moment, and switching models in response would hide a platform incident behind a quality
    regression that nobody would ever attribute correctly. The fallback path is exercised by
    ``tests/test_models_client.py`` rather than first executed in production.
*   **``max_tokens`` has a floor.** The reasoning models spend 150 to 215 tokens thinking before
    writing anything, on every call, and it cannot be disabled. Under the floor, the endpoint
    returns HTTP 200 with ``finish_reason: "length"`` and an empty answer. That looks exactly
    like a model that cannot do the task and is not one: it already produced one false negative
    in this project's own verification harness. The floor is checked before the request, and a
    truncation that survives the check is raised as a parameter bug rather than salvaged.
*   **Structured output goes through ``response_format {type: json_schema, strict: true}`` and
    nowhere else.** A top-level ``guided_json`` is accepted and silently ignored: HTTP 200,
    prose body, no schema enforced. This client refuses to send it, and refuses any
    ``response_format`` it did not build, so naked prose cannot enter canonical state through it.
*   **Sending a schema is not the same as the schema being enforced, so the reply is validated
    locally against the exact schema that was sent.** ``guided_json`` proved on this very
    platform that a constraint parameter can be accepted, ignored, and answered with an HTTP 200
    that looks fine. Every reply to a request carrying a ``response_format`` comes back through
    ``ChatResult.payload`` already checked, so a caller with a hand-written schema gets the same
    guarantee ``structured`` gives rather than inheriting raw text.
*   **Reasoning text is separated from the answer, and an ambiguous answer is refused.** Both
    observed shapes are handled; see ``orimera.models.reasoning``. Where the scratch work is
    untagged and contains a draft JSON object, there is nothing in the body identifying which
    object is the answer, and the call fails rather than guessing. See
    ``orimera.models.schema.extract_json_object``.

The client holds a cache, a budget guard and a ledger. All three are optional collaborators with
inert defaults, so a caller gets no caching and generous limits unless it asks, and a test gets
exact ones.
