"""Errors raised by the model client, the manifest and the preflight.

Kept separate from ``orimera.errors``, which is about the evidence spine and the object store.
Every class here inherits ``OrimeraError`` so a caller can still catch the whole package with
one except clause.

Several of these are control-flow relevant rather than decorative:

*   ``ModelUnavailableError`` is what triggers the fallback. Nothing else does.
*   ``BudgetExceededError`` must not be retried; retrying is the runaway loop it exists to stop.
*   ``TruncatedResponseError`` names a configuration mistake, not a model failure, and says so,
    because the opposite reading has already cost this project one wrong conclusion.

    scratch work about a JSON schema routinely contains a draft object. When the scratch work is
    tagged it is stripped before extraction and this never arises. When it is not, there is no
    evidence in the body saying which object is the answer: "the first" and "the last" are both
    guesses, and a wrong guess writes the model's placeholder into canonical state as a fact.

    Refusing is the correct answer. A refused call is a visible failure that costs one retry; a
    guessed one is an invented memory that nobody ever attributes to the parser.
