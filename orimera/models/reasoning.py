"""Separating a reasoning model's scratch work from its answer.

The reasoning models on this platform spend roughly 150 to 215 tokens thinking on every call and
that cannot be switched off. Where the thinking text ends up is the part the documentation gets
wrong, so this module handles **both** observed shapes rather than trusting either:

*   ``message.reasoning_content`` (and its sibling ``message.reasoning``) populated, with
    ``message.content`` holding a clean answer. This is what every archived verification response
    actually shows, including the structured-output one where ``content`` was exactly
    ``{"colours": [...]}`` while ``reasoning_content`` held five numbered thinking steps.
*   Thinking inlined in ``message.content`` inside a ``<think>`` block. `runtime-verification.md`
    section 5 states this is what happens and that ``reasoning_content`` is null. Its own
    archived artifacts contradict it. That contradiction is flagged in the handoff notes; the
    code refuses to depend on which one is right, because being wrong in either direction means
    a model's scratch work is parsed as a fact.

The third case is the dangerous one and it is why ``complete`` exists: an **unterminated** open
tag means the token limit was reached mid-thought. There is no answer in that response, only a
truncated thought, and a caller that treats the fragment as an answer has invented a fact.
