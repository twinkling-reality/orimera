"""Pydantic model to ``json_schema`` strict, the only mechanism allowed to write canonical state.

Three mechanisms were measured against this endpoint. Exactly one is used:

===================================================  =========================================
``response_format {type: json_schema, strict: true}``  valid JSON. This module builds it.
``response_format {type: json_object}``                valid JSON, but no schema enforced.
top-level ``guided_json``                              **silently ignored**, returns prose, 200.
===================================================  =========================================

The third is the reason this module exists as a chokepoint rather than a helper. A parameter
that is accepted and ignored produces an HTTP 200 with a plausible prose answer, so a pipeline
using it looks like it works while enforcing nothing at all. ``orimera.models.client`` refuses to
send it, and refuses any ``response_format`` this module did not build.

Strict mode has requirements Pydantic's own schema does not meet, so ``strict_json_schema``
hardens the output: every object gets ``additionalProperties: false``, every property is listed
in ``required``, and annotations that carry no constraint (``title``, ``default``) are dropped so
the payload is deterministic. Listing every property as required is not a stylistic choice; it is
what strict mode demands. Fields that are genuinely optional must therefore be typed to admit
``None``, and the model can then return an explicit null rather than omitting the key, which is
the difference between "the model did not find one" and "the model forgot".

A hand-written schema is supported too, through ``response_format_for_schema``. The vision
observation schema is written by hand deliberately: a generated one carries ``$defs`` and
``anyOf``, which a strict-mode endpoint may reject or, worse, accept while ignoring. The
chokepoint is the same either way, because the client refuses any ``response_format`` that is
not ``json_schema`` with ``strict: true``.

``extract_json_object`` is the reader half. It exists because of `runtime-verification.md` section
5:
the reasoning models write scratch work **inline in ``message.content``** and it cannot be
switched off. Tagged scratch work is removed upstream by ``orimera.models.reasoning``; untagged
prose in front of the object is not, and ``json.loads`` on the whole body fails on exactly the
models this project runs.

**The extractor does not guess which object is the answer.** It used to take the first balanced
object in the body, and a measured Nemotron response of the shape ``a minimal example would be
{"scene_description": "PLACEHOLDER FROM MY SCRATCH WORK"} ... my real answer is:
{"scene_description": "A waterfall in a forest."}`` therefore returned the placeholder. The
placeholder is schema-valid, so every downstream check passed it and it was persisted as an
assertion about a photograph. Taking the last object instead would have got that one case right
and is still a guess: nothing in the body says which object is the answer, and the models are
free to write their scratch work after their conclusion.

So the rule here is:

1.  Reasoning that carries a delimiter is stripped before extraction ever runs. That is
    ``orimera.models.reasoning``, and it is the only reliable separation available.
2.  What survives is scanned for **every** top-level balanced object that parses. Candidates
    that are equal carry no ambiguity and collapse to one.
3.  Exactly one distinct candidate is the answer. Zero is a failed call. **Two or more is
    refused**, because picking one would be inventing the provenance of a fact.

Refusal costs a retry. A guess costs a memory that never happened, attributed to nobody.

``validate_against_schema`` is the other half of the reader. Sending
``response_format {json_schema, strict}`` is a request, not a guarantee: a server that ignores it
answers HTTP 200 with a well-formed object of the wrong shape, and the ``guided_json`` result in
`runtime-verification.md` section 6 is that exact failure one layer down. The payload is therefore
validated locally against the byte-identical schema that was sent, so the enforcement does not
depend on the endpoint honouring it.
