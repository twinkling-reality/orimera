"""Writing the ``.opm`` container, from Python, for the same decoder the fixtures feed.

``.opm`` had one producer, ``@orimera/scene-synth``, which writes synthetic fixtures for the
renderer bake-off. This is the second, and it writes what a real photograph turned out to have
been looking at. Both are read by the same decoder in ``@orimera/atlas-react``, which is the
point: the renderer cannot tell a synthetic fixture from a reconstruction, so a measurement taken
against the fixture is a measurement of the real path.

**This is OPM/2, and OPM/1 is refused rather than upgraded.** ADR-0010 D9: there is no
upgrade-on-read, because nothing in production held a file to upgrade when the version was cut.
The magic stays ``OPM1`` because it names the format and not the version, which is the same
arrangement glTF has; the version is in the header, where a reader that can read the header can
tell whether it can read the rest.

**The section table below is the container, and every offset and stride is computed from it.**
ADR-0010 D2: "Readers compute every offset and stride from the header rather than from a
constant, and a registered optional section is not a version bump. This is what makes the
header's generic shape true and is the only part of the change that prevents the next attribute
from being another version." Under OPM/1 exactly three sections were hardcoded in both
validators and in the decoder, and the stride was the literal 18 in the renderer binding, so the
header's own generic section list was a fiction. One table here, one in the decoder, and
:mod:`orimera.reconstruction.validation` reads this one rather than restating it.

**The layout is contiguous on purpose, and that is not a detail.** The decoder reports
``planarContiguous`` and the PlayCanvas binding takes a zero-copy path when it is true and a
per-point CPU repack when it is false. PlayCanvas holds exactly one vertex buffer per mesh and
computes its own offsets for a tightly packed planar format, so it cannot be told to read three
attributes from three unrelated places. This writer aligns the START of the first section and
then packs the rest immediately after, so the file is always on the fast path. The TypeScript
writer's per-section sixteen-byte alignment is superseded by name in ADR-0010, for the same
reason: it was contiguous only when the point count happened to be a multiple of four.

The alignment that remains is the alignment that matters: the first section starts on a
sixteen-byte boundary, so a ``Float32Array`` view over it is legal; colour is bytes and needs
none; and ``tags`` begins sixteen bytes per point after that, which is even, so a
``Uint16Array`` view over it is legal too. Every one of those numbers is a consequence of the
table rather than a fact about it, so the writer asserts the property instead of restating the
arithmetic, and a section added in the wrong order fails here rather than in a browser.

**Two fields the synthetic writer has are absent here.** ``seed`` and ``sceneName`` describe a
generated world and there is no honest value for them over a photograph. They are omitted rather
than filled with a zero and an empty string, and the decoder does not read either.
