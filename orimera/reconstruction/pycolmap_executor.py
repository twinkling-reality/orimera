"""COLMAP in this process, so pose recovery runs where the photographs already are.

``pose.py`` drives COLMAP through a ``CommandExecutor`` seam, and its default shells out to a
``colmap`` binary. That binary is not installed on a developer machine and is not in the
container image, so the pose job has never run: it is a controller with no backend, and
``docs/colmap-pose-jobs.md`` records exactly that. This module is the backend. It recognises the
four command shapes ``pose.py`` emits and performs each one through ``pycolmap`` in process,
returning the same ``CommandResult`` the subprocess executor returns, so the checkpointing, the
lock, the manifest digest, the receipt and the quality gate above it are unchanged and untested
code paths do not multiply.

**Why in process rather than a bundled binary.** ``pycolmap`` publishes a macOS arm64 wheel and
needs no CUDA, so the same code recovers poses on the laptop that holds the library and on the
Linux worker. MEASURED 2026-09-02 on an Apple M3 Pro, pycolmap 4.2.0, CPU only, on eight
1024x768 renders: feature extraction 1.4 s, exhaustive matching 0.4 s, incremental mapping 1.8 s,
all eight images registered at 0.44 px mean reprojection error. The full table, and the caveat
that those inputs were renders of a monocular point map rather than photographs, is in
``docs/reconstruction-findings.md`` section 3.

**Two behaviours are set here rather than left to the defaults, and both are recorded because
they change what the job can produce.**

``random_seed`` is fixed. COLMAP's mapper seeds itself from the clock by default, so two runs of
one manifest produce different point counts, and the roadmap's Phase 3B gate asks for a report
reproducible from the same manifest. A fixed seed is necessary for that and is not sufficient:
RANSAC threading still admits variation, and how much has not been measured.

``ignore_two_view_tracks`` is left at its default, which is to discard every track a two-image
model would produce. MEASURED: with the default, two images never register at all, whatever the
baseline, because the initial pair is accepted and then dropped for having no points. Turning it
off makes pairs register, and it is deliberately not turned off here: a two-image model is the
case where a pose is least constrained, and the honest place to relax it is a manifest field
somebody chose, not a default nobody saw.

**The import is lazy, and on macOS it must stay that way for a second reason.** ``pycolmap`` is an
optional extra and CI does not install it, so a module-scope import would take the whole suite
down in the one environment that has to stay green. But MEASURED 2026-09-03 on this machine, with
pycolmap 4.2.0 and torch 2.14.0 both installed: **importing both into one process aborts**, in
either order, with ``OMP: Error #15: Initializing libomp.dylib, but found libomp.dylib already
initialized`` followed by SIGABRT. Each wheel carries its own OpenMP runtime. The documented
escape, ``KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE``, does let both load, and OpenMP's own message says it "may
cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results", so it is not set here and should not be set
by a caller: a silently wrong pose is worse than a refused one.

The consequence is architectural rather than cosmetic. **Depth and pose cannot share a process on
macOS.** They do not need to: they are separate stages over separate inputs, the pose job already
owns a manifest and a job directory, and the barrel does not import the depth model, so
``from orimera.reconstruction import run_colmap_pose_job`` pulls no torch. A caller that wants
both on one machine runs them as two processes. On Linux the two wheels have not been tested
together here, and nothing should assume they coexist until they have been.
