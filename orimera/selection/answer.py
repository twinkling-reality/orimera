"""The answer object, the validator that refuses it, and the answer that exists regardless.

``architecture-overview.md`` 5.3 makes answers structured rather than prose: "per-clause text, a
clause type in ``historical | uncertain | meta``, citation tokens, and value references. Prose is
rendered client side from the structure."

Three enforcement mechanisms, "none of which depends on the model behaving":

1. **Tokens are unforgeable and packet-scoped.** A citation that does not resolve is a lookup
   failure, not a judgement call.
2. **No digit sequence may appear in clause text unless a value reference covers it.** A
   syntactic check on the output string, not a semantic one. It kills the highest-damage
   hallucination class in a memory product: a confidently invented date, count or duration.
3. **On a second failure the model output is discarded entirely** and a deterministic answer is
   rendered from the query result and its citations.

Point 3 is what makes 1 and 2 safe to enforce strictly, and it is the reason this module ends
with a renderer rather than an exception: "rejecting model output has a defined, useful outcome,
so the validator has no incentive to be lenient." A correct, cited answer exists at zero model
compliance.

**Abstention is an answer, not a failure.** When the packet is empty the composer is never
called. Guessing from an empty packet is the one thing a memory product must not do, and the
cheapest way to guarantee it is to have no code path that could.
