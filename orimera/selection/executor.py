"""Stages 5 and 6: compile a validated plan to parameterized SQL, and run it deterministically.

No model runs in this module. That is the property the whole design rests on: a plan may have
come from a language model, and what happens to it afterwards is a fixed compiler and a fixed
query. ``architecture-overview.md`` 5.1 puts it as "a fixed compiler turns the plan into
parameterized SQL with **zero string interpolation of model output**".

That claim is checkable, and it is worth stating exactly what makes it true here:

*   Every SQL fragment in this file is a literal in this file. Which fragments are used is
    decided by ``if`` statements over enum members, so the set of possible statements is finite
    and enumerable by reading the source.
*   Every value from the plan is bound. Ids are bound as ``uuid[]``, times as ``timestamptz``,
    the limit as an integer.
*   The one free-text field goes to ``plainto_tsquery``, not ``to_tsquery``. The difference is
    the whole safety argument: ``plainto_tsquery`` treats its input as plain words and discards
    operator syntax, so ``'gullfoss & secret | admin'`` becomes ``'gullfoss' & 'secret' &
    'admin'`` rather than a boolean expression the caller authored. Verified on the server.

Execution runs in a **read-only transaction with a statement timeout**, per 5.2 stage 6. Both
matter and they are not the same guarantee: read-only means a plan cannot write whatever
happens upstream of it, and the timeout means a plan cannot hold a connection open. The
deployment adds a third, which is that the executor connects as ``orimera_ro``, a role that
holds SELECT and nothing else.
