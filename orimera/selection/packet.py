"""The bounded evidence packet, and the tokens that make a hallucinated citation impossible.

``architecture-overview.md`` 5.3: "The model never sees the corpus. It sees an **EvidencePacket**
of at most 24 EvidenceItems, assembled by the deterministic query path. Each item carries a
random 10-character token that is valid only within that one packet, mapped server side to
``(span_id, assertion_id)`` for the lifetime of the request."

The token design is doing something specific, and it is worth being precise about what:

    "The token space is unforgeable and packet-scoped. The model cannot construct a valid
    reference to anything outside its packet, because tokens are random per request and resolve
    only through a server-side map. A hallucinated citation is not a wrong citation, it is a
    lookup failure, detected deterministically. There is no 'plausible-looking' failure mode."

That last sentence is the reason this is not a confidence heuristic. A model inventing
``ev_7Kq2mN`` produces a token that resolves to nothing, and the difference between "cited
correctly" and "made it up" is a dictionary lookup rather than a judgement.

**Value references** are the second mechanism. A clause may contain no digit sequence unless a
value reference covers it, so a confidently invented date, count or duration cannot survive. The
values are computed here from the query result, never from the model, and each one carries the
exact string the answer is permitted to use.

**Two things a packet refuses to be built from.** A result reached under
``include_proposals`` cannot be cited, because an ``auto_provisional`` link is a guess and a
historical clause may not rest on one. And an empty result produces an empty packet rather than
a smaller one, because the correct response to no evidence is abstention, not a shorter answer.

**Everything in ``text`` is untrusted.** Captions and OCR are model output over pixels the
system did not author, and a photograph of a sign reading "ignore your instructions" is a
photograph a user may legitimately own. The packet carries the tier so the composer's prompt can
say so, and the answer validator does not trust the composer to have listened: a clause is
checked against the packet, not against what the packet's text asked for.
