    The CLI is the one caller that opens its own connections: ``_repository`` calls
    ``Database.from_env()``, which resolves ``ORIMERA_DATABASE_URL`` and connects several times
    over a single command. So the throwaway schema goes on the ``search_path`` inside the URL
    rather than being set with a statement afterwards, because there is no connection object to
    hand it a statement on.

    Two things then have to be arranged before the CLI can run against a schema the harness
    migrated, and neither is guesswork; both were observed:

    *   **``schema_migrations`` is empty even though the schema is fully migrated.** The table
        is created by migration 0001, but the rows that say a version was applied are written
        by :func:`orimera.db.apply_pending`, and the harness applies the files directly. The
        CLI would therefore find nothing applied, try 0001 again, and fail on ``type
        "assertion_kind" already exists``. Recording what the harness applied makes the
        bookkeeping agree with the schema that is actually there, which is also the only
        honest description of it.
    *   **Workspace scoping alone does not isolate two CLI tests.** ``artifact_id`` is
        ``uuid5`` over the idempotency key, and that key is a hash of the source bytes, the
        stage and its parameters, with no workspace in it. Two tests that ingest byte-identical
        photographs therefore compute the same primary key under different workspaces, and the
        second insert dies on ``artifact_pkey`` rather than being absorbed by ``on conflict
        (workspace_id, idempotency_key)``. Row-level security does not help here: a unique
        index is enforced over rows the policy hides. So the tables are wiped between tests
        exactly as :func:`ingest_spine` wipes them, and a fresh workspace per test is a convenience
        rather than the isolation mechanism.
