"""Applying migration 0001 to a real server, for the tests that need one.

Three things about this migration make a naive harness wrong, and all three were learned by
running it:

*   **The file carries its own ``begin;`` and ``commit;``.** Applying it and then calling
    ``rollback()`` does not undo it: the embedded COMMIT has already landed by the time control
    returns. A harness written that way silently leaves a schema behind, and the next run fails
    with "type assertion_kind already exists". So the schema is created inside a throwaway
    namespace and that namespace is dropped afterwards.
*   **The target is PostgreSQL 18 with pgvector, and this harness now requires it.** An earlier
    version substituted ``gen_random_uuid()`` for ``uuidv7()`` and ``bytea`` for
    ``halfvec(4096)`` so that the suite could run on an older server. That made the suite green
    while the vector path had never executed even once, and it hid a real defect: a test wrote
    raw bytes into ``embedding.v`` and passed, because under the substitution the column was
    ``bytea``. A wrong server is now a loud failure naming what is missing, not a silent fake.
*   **Extensions are database-wide objects and ``create extension if not exists`` races.** Two
    connections applying the migration at once can both pass the existence check, and the loser
    gets ``duplicate key (extname)``. They are created here, once, in ``public``, under an
    advisory lock, before the throwaway schema goes on the search path. Creating them inside the
    scratch schema instead would put ``halfvec`` somewhere the next run cannot resolve and would
    drop it again with the schema.

Nothing outside the throwaway schema is read or written, apart from those extensions, and the
database name must contain "test" before the harness will touch it at all.
