"""The HTTP surface, including the authorisation sweep that is generated from the router.

``evaluation-methodology.md`` M10 specifies how the authorisation half is tested, and the shape
of the requirement is unusual enough to quote:

    "**DECISION: table-driven, generated from the router, so a new route without a test fails
    CI.** User U1 owns the corpus; U2 owns nothing. For every read path, assert U2 receives a
    not-found response: API routes, citation deep links, share links, graph API, query API, and
    direct object storage URLs. **404, never 403**, so the surface is not an existence oracle.
    Nonexistent and foreign IDs return the identical code."

So the sweep below does not enumerate routes by hand. It walks ``app.routes``, and a route that
is neither exercised nor explicitly listed as public fails the test. Adding an endpoint without
thinking about who may call it is not possible here; the suite goes red.
