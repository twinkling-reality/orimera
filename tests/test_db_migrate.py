"""Applying migrations to a real server, which is what every process does at startup.

``tests/pg_harness.py`` applies the files directly, because what it needs is a schema. This
covers the other path, :func:`orimera.db.apply_pending`, which is the one the command line and
anything else with a ``Database`` actually calls, and which additionally has to decide what is
already applied and record what it applied.

The distinction matters in one specific way that has already bitten: a fully migrated schema
whose ``schema_migrations`` table is empty is indistinguishable, to this function, from an empty
database, so it tries 0001 again and dies on ``type "assertion_kind" already exists``. That is
the correct direction to fail in, and it is why the CLI fixture in ``conftest.py`` records what
the harness applied rather than letting the two disagree.
