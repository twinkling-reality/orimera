"""The deployment artefacts, checked at the level a text file can be checked at.

These are text assertions over a Dockerfile, a compose file and a workflow, and a text assertion
is the weaker half of any pair. What makes them worth having is that the failures they catch are
the ones nobody notices until a deployment: an image whose entry point cannot import its own
package, a health check pointing at readiness, a database volume the server does not write to.

No YAML parser is used, deliberately. There is none in the dev dependency closure, and adding one
so a test can read a file it could read as text is a dependency bought for a test.
