"""R20: a claim is a lease, and what happens to the worker whose lease was taken.

Every test here holds one half of a distinction the register said was not guessable, and each of
them was confirmed by reverting the change it covers and watching it go red.

The two halves are the whole point. A reclaim that fires on a dead claimant and NOT on a slow live
one is the feature; a reclaim that fires on both is the defect the register warned against, and
`claimed_at` alone produces exactly that. Measured with two real worker processes against a real
database: a worker eight four-second captures into a job under a ten second lease was called
stranded by a `claimed_at` predicate for 24 consecutive seconds and was never called stranded by
the lease.

The token gets two tests rather than one because it prevents two different writes: the claimed
job's terminal state, and the watched batch's terminal event. Measured with the token removed and
two real processes: the reclaiming worker wrote `succeeded` and the original wrote `failed` over
the same batch 4.5 seconds later, with a fresh `ended_at`, after the client's stream had already
ended on the first.
