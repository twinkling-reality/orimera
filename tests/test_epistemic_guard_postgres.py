"""The epistemic guard, executed against a real PostgreSQL server.

Everything in ``test_migration.py`` is a text check over the migration file. A text check cannot
tell the difference between a rule the database enforces and a rule the file merely describes,
and that difference is exactly what the review found: ``predicate.allows_kind`` was declared,
documented as the reason "there is no code path in which a model writes a name", and enforced by
nothing. A live probe inserted ``kind='inference'`` against ``name_is`` with the object value
``"Aunt Marjorie"`` and it landed with ``status='active'``.

So these tests write the offending rows and require the database to refuse them.

Running them
------------
Set ``EXULANICA_TEST_DATABASE_URL`` to a scratch database; without it every test here skips, which
is the normal state on a machine with no server. The server must be the documented target,
PostgreSQL 18 with pgvector: nothing is substituted, and a server that cannot run the schema
fails loudly rather than being faked. ``tests/pg_harness.py`` explains how the schema is applied
and torn down. Each test runs inside a savepoint, so no test sees another one's rows.
