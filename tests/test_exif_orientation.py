"""Orientation, which is where a naive photograph pipeline quietly goes wrong.

A phone writes the sensor readout unrotated and records how to display it in one tag. Ignore
the tag and every portrait photograph is processed sideways: the model describes a rotated
scene and every box it returns lands on the wrong axis. Four of the eight values also include
a mirror, which no amount of rotation can express.

These tests pin the decision recorded in ``orimera/ingest/exif.py``: normalise pixels at
ingest, record that it happened, and put every region in upright display space.
