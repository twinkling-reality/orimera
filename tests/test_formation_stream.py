"""The formation stream: the ledger projected into the phases a person can see.

The property most of this file is about is that a RESUMED stream tells the same story as an
uninterrupted one. Server-sent events are redelivered on reconnect and a client resumes from its
last event id, so a counter computed against the present rather than against the point in history
being replayed would make a reconnect show numbers jumping for a reason nobody could explain.

The other half is that the two vocabularies stay in step. The ordered list of visible stages
exists in this repository twice, once in Python and once in TypeScript, and it has to, because
neither language can import the other's. So it is pinned by a test that reads both.
