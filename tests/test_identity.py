"""Identity: naming a person, finding them again, and being allowed to change your mind.

This is the recurrence thesis at its smallest honest size. Two photographs, one person, one
account holder who says so. Everything here is rung one, user-asserted identity: nothing
computes an embedding, nothing proposes a match, and nothing needs the open biometric question
answered before it can run.

Four properties are what this file exists to pin, and each of them has a specific failure it
prevents:

*   **A name comes only from the account holder.** Not from a detector, not from a caption, not
    from a direct UPDATE. The last one is the interesting case: it is the route that bypasses
    every line of Python in this repository.
*   **A confirmed link is a human decision.** ``auto_provisional`` may drive layout; only
    ``user_confirm`` may support a claim.
*   **A rejection is durable, evidence-keyed, and revocable.** Keyed by ``occurrence_id`` it
    would evaporate on the next detector run; keyed without the basis it would gag a genuinely
    better proposal forever; deleted rather than revoked it would erase that the user ever said
    no.
*   **Every decision is an event, and the event is enough to undo it.** Not approximately.

# attribute always bypass the row security system", so on this connection the predicate inside
# each statement is the ONLY thing scoping the read, and dropping one leaks. On a non-superuser
# connection the same drop is unobservable by construction: `ws_isolation` already filters to
# `current_workspace()`, so the query returns the same rows either way. The two facts need two
# different roles, and the other one is in `test_row_level_security.py`.
