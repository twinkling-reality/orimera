"""The command line, which is mostly a promise that running it twice is safe.

The second run must say what it skipped and why. A tool that silently does nothing looks
identical to a tool that silently did everything again and billed for it.

Unlike every other test of the ingest path, nothing here is handed a repository. The CLI
resolves its own database from ``ORIMERA_DATABASE_URL`` and opens its own connections, and that
resolution is part of what is being tested, so the ``cli_database`` fixture points that variable
at the throwaway schema instead of substituting a connection. The five model-wiring tests at the
bottom touch no database at all and ask for nothing.
