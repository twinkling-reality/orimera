"""Idempotency, which is a cost control before it is a correctness control.

Every derivative is keyed by ``(source blob, stage, stage version, params, input digest)``. The
consequence these tests pin down: **a second run over the same directory makes zero model
calls.** Without that, re-running the pipeline after any change means paying for every vision
call again, every time, and the bill arrives as one number at the end of the month.

These run against a real PostgreSQL server, because there is nothing else left to run them
against. That is more than a change of address. The re-run that actually costs money is a new
process, so it is a new connection, and only rows that were committed are visible to it: the
``ingest_spine`` fixture's ``open_another()`` is that second process, and one test below uses
it. And
the deduplication the repository writes as ``insert ... on conflict do nothing`` is backed by
unique constraints the database enforces on every route into the table, so one test reaches
those constraints with raw SQL instead of trusting the repository to have been careful.

The whole file skips when ``EXULANICA_TEST_DATABASE_URL`` is unset; see ``tests/pg_harness.py``.
