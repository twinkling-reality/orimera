"""What ends up persisted, and under which provenance class.

Four things are checked here, and each one is an invariant that a plausible-looking pipeline
gets wrong:

*   Capture-supported observation, model inference and user statement are three different
    things. A caption filed as a capture fact is a guess rendered as a measurement.
*   Every evidence address resolves back to the original bytes, and a span read out of the
    database rebuilds to the same digest it was stored under.
*   The ledger records what actually happened, in enough detail that the Assembly Replay does
    not have to read the source code.
*   A tombstoned address refuses the write, terminally.

These run against the real spine, which changes what several of them are able to prove. The
epistemic and tombstone guards used to be application code, because the SQLite mirror the
ingest path ran on could not express a trigger; the assertions against ``IngestRepository``
were therefore the whole guarantee. They are now the *error message*, and the guarantee is a
BEFORE trigger that refuses the same write on routes that never touch this class. So each of
those tests now makes the offending write twice: once through the repository, which must fail
with a sentence naming the rule, and once as raw SQL through the same connection, which must
fail with an SQLSTATE. Neither check subsumes the other, and the second is the one an
application bug cannot remove.

    them, so the next stage wrote a derivative of a photograph the user had just deleted.

    Measured before migration 0011: the rendition row and its bytes were committed. After it, the
    artifact insert is refused inside the writing transaction, and because
    ``committed_writes`` flushes bytes only after that transaction commits, refusing the row
    refuses the bytes with it.

    What this does NOT close is the derivative written BEFORE the tombstone arrived. That is the
    purge queue, and it is still unimplemented.
