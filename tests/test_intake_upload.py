"""``POST /intake``, and the property the route exists to keep: the queue holds no bytes.

The tests here are grouped by what they hold, and the grouping matters more than the count.

*   **The eight checks**, one test each, so a refusal that stops saying which check it was
    fails rather than degrades.
*   **The deletion properties.** An evidence address is a content hash of the original bytes,
    and the deletion cascade reaches the rows under the tombstone guards and the objects in the
    content-addressed store. Bytes staged anywhere else are reachable by neither, which is why
    the queue holds a capture id, and there is a test that reads the queue row and asserts that.
*   **Defect 4, which the obvious implementation regresses.** The store write must still land
    after the transaction that ran the tombstone guard commits. A route that wrote the uploaded
    bytes to the store on arrival, which is the natural way to put them somewhere guarded, puts
    purged bytes back on disk when the import is refused.
*   **The two halves joining up.** Intake in the request, derivatives in the worker, and the
    same capture at the end of both.
