"""Automatic match proposals, from context and never from biometrics.

Before this, ``match_proposal`` was written by nothing and identity was rung one: the account
holder says who somebody is. These tests are the second rung, and the thing they are most
concerned with is the rule that stops it becoming a nag.

Decision id-4: a rejected match is never re-proposed identically, and a proposal built from
genuinely DIFFERENT signals is still permitted to ask again. That is a subset test over modality
sets, and until migration 0008 it could not be computed at all: ``identity_rejection`` stored a
digest and no modality list, and a digest is opaque. What existed was digest equality, which
under-suppresses in the dangerous direction, because ``basis_digest`` covers extractor versions
and a version bump would therefore revive every rejection the user had already answered.
