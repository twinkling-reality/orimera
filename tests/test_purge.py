"""The object-store purge, and the seven corrections its design needed.

R18's other half. Migration 0011 stopped a derivative of tombstoned bytes being created at all;
this is what removes the ones written before the tombstone arrived.

**Every test here is about a way this could destroy the wrong thing or claim it destroyed
something it did not.** That is the shape of the risk: a purger that refuses too much leaves
files on a disk, and a purger that refuses too little takes a photograph somebody still has. The
second is not recoverable and is why the predicates raise rather than answer when they cannot
see enough to be sure.

Six of the corrections came off the defect register. The seventh, that the destroy predicate
cannot see another tenant's live capture and answers "destroy", was found by running the design
against a real database as a real role, and one of the tests below is that measurement.
