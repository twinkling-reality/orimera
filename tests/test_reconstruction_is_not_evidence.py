"""Invariant 2, tested for real: reconstruction is never evidence.

``docs/domain-and-evidence-model.md``: an evidence address is (content hash of the ORIGINAL
bytes, track key, exact rational time interval) and nothing else, and no function may return a
rendition, a point map, or a rendered view as a citation target.

Until reconstruction existed this invariant was true by having nothing to violate it with. It
now has a producer, and the whole product rests on the sentence it protects: reconstruction
quality never participates in the truth guarantee. A region may degrade to a photograph on a
plane and the factual promise is unchanged, which is only true while a citation cannot resolve to
geometry.

Four checks, weakest first, and the ordering is deliberate.

*   The reconstruction package **cannot name an evidence address**, because it does not import the
    module that defines one. A rule kept by an absent import is kept for code nobody reviewed.
*   A point map is **never registered as a blob**. Spans reference ``blob``; artifacts do not
    live there, so a point map has nothing a span could point at.
*   Every span in a workspace names bytes **some capture claims**. That is the positive form of
    the same statement and it would catch a span created over a derivative by any route.
*   A permalink naming a point map's hash is **refused with the same 404** a nonexistent span
    gets, over HTTP, which is the surface an attacker or a confused client actually has.
