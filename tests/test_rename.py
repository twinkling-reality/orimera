"""Renaming an entity, and the trap that R16 set for it.

The API could name an occurrence and could not rename an entity. Migration 0006 makes `name_is`
supersede, which is what makes a rename one assertion rather than a retraction plus a write. It
also makes the obvious implementation blank the name, silently, and that is what most of this
file is about.
