"""Scene grouping, and the line between a proposal and a fact.

Grouping photographs by time and position is what turns a folder into somewhere the user has
been. It is also the easiest place in the system to quietly assert something: a cluster with a
confident label looks exactly like a known place. It is not one, and these tests pin that.

The first five tests are arithmetic over dicts and touch no database. Everything below the
``grouped`` fixture runs against a real PostgreSQL server, because the derived rows, their
dependency index and the ledger events are the whole point: a proposal that is not persisted as
a proposal has not been shown to be one.
