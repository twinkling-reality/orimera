"""A fact about N photographs, and the deletion of one of them.

ADR-0009 D9. Every artifact before migration 0024 is keyed to exactly one source blob, which is
what the purge cascade and the export projector join on, and a pose receipt, a splat and a
placement record are facts about a set. D9 gives them a subject and requires that deletion reach
it: "a tombstone path that reaches a scene artifact through any of its members".

**The reduction inverts, and that is what every test here is about.** For an artifact of one
photograph the question is an OR over the captures holding a blob: imported twice is one artifact
and two captures, and deleting one withdraws nothing. ``purge_releases_bytes`` and
``orimera/graph/geometry.py`` both read that way and are right to. For a fact about eight
photographs, deleting ONE withdraws it, because a receipt over eight is not a claim about the
seven that are left.

**Three members, and the one that is deleted is the middle one.** D9's no-ship rule is "the test
that deletes one of N members and asserts the bytes are released and the export changes", and a
test that deleted every member would pass on either reduction, which is the failure the defect
register calls this project's recurring one. Two members would leave the surviving-member
assertions trivial. The middle one rather than an end, because the presentation order this
workspace is read in is ``started_at`` then ``capture_id``, so a deletion at either end would be
indistinguishable from an off-by-one in anything that walks the list.

Both halves of the no-ship rule are here, under "the export" below: the bytes go through the
purge queue and the export through ``orimera/world_package/projector.py``. They are in one file
rather than split across this and ``tests/test_world_package_postgres.py`` because D9 states them
as one rule, and a reader checking whether it is met should not have to find the second half.
