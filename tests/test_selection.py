"""The Selection primitive: what may be asked, what is refused, and what comes back.

Everything here is deterministic. No model runs in any of these tests, and that is the point
being demonstrated rather than a convenience: a plan may have come from a language model, and
what happens to it afterwards is a fixed validator and a fixed compiler. The two model calls in
the path have their own file.

The set-algebra cases come from ``evaluation-methodology.md`` M6, which sets the bar at
"**Set exact-match rate**: returned photograph or region set equals the gold set. **Pass: 100%.**
This is set algebra over a known graph. Anything below 100% is a bug, not a model limitation."
Its trap (c) is called "the single highest-value trap in the suite, because it is where a filter
of this shape silently goes wrong", and it has a test below by that name.
