"""R4. The vocabulary row nobody decided on.

``writes_a_name`` cannot be enforced and this file does not pretend to enforce it. What it does
is refuse a predicate that reached a migration without a decision reaching the register, and
refuse a decision that is not an answer.

Deliberately database-free. The assertion that used to carry part of this was ``len(rows) == 12``
in ``test_epistemic_guard_postgres.py``, which skips on any machine with no server, and whose
repair when a predicate was added was to type 13.
