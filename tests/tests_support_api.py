"""Building a Database pointed at the harness's throwaway schema.

The API resolves its own connections through :class:`orimera.db.session.Database`, so a test
cannot hand it an already-open connection the way the repository tests do. The schema goes on
the search path inside the URL instead, which is the same mechanism the command line tests use
and for the same reason: there is no connection object to issue a statement on.
