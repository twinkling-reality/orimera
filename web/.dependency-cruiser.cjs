/**
 * The forbidden-imports contract from docs/architecture-overview.md section 1.1, as an
 * enforced rule set rather than a table in a document.
 *
 * A boundary nobody checks is not a boundary. `pnpm run boundaries` fails the build.
 *
 * Three layers of enforcement exist in this workspace and they cover different things:
 *
 *   1. This file          - forbidden MODULE imports (React, renderers, cross-package edges).
 *   2. tsconfig `lib`     - forbidden AMBIENT globals. atlas-core and companion-runtime compile
 *                           without lib.dom, so `document`, `window` and `HTMLElement` are type
 *                           errors, not review comments. A lint rule cannot catch a global.
 *   3. graph-client       - the runtime proposal-id check on every mutation. Documented as a
 *                           runtime check on purpose: it must hold for code that was never linted.
