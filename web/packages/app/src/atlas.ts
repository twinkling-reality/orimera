/**
 * Mounting the renderer. The one file in this package that knows a renderer exists.
 *
 * ADR-0003 resolved to PlayCanvas Engine 2.21.4, and `@orimera/atlas-react` is the binding.
 * Everything engine-specific lives behind that package, which is what makes a renderer switch a
 * two-package change; nothing here names `playcanvas`, and `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` would fail
 * the build if it did.
 *
 * **Point maps arrive from the caller, and an island without one is anchors only.**
 * `AtlasBinding` takes one point map per island; a region absent from the map is rung 4 rendered
 * as rung 4. This file does not decide which regions have geometry and must not: production
 * reads that from the API and the preview loads a reconstruction from disk, and a default
 * chosen here would be a third answer that neither of them asked for.
 *
 * That sentence was false when it was written, and ADR-0009 D10 says so: "the app's own comment
 * claiming that production reads point maps from an API describes an implementation that does not
 * exist". It is true now. `geometry-api.ts` is the production reader, `dev/preview-point-maps.ts`
 * is the preview one, and `main.ts` holds one variable that either of them fills.
 *
 * It is also the thesis under test. Reconstruction quality never participates in the truth
 * guarantee: a region with no geometry at all still resolves every citation to the exact
 * original photograph, and this file is where that stops being a claim in a document.
 *
 * **The placement check runs at startup and its result is reported, not swallowed.** A sign error
 * in a yaw is invisible until somebody walks round the back of a region, and the binding offers
 * a check for exactly that. Running it and discarding the answer would be the same as not
 * running it.
