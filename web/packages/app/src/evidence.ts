/**
 * Opening a citation, which is the promise the whole product reduces to.
 *
 * **Bytes, not a URL.** `OrimeraClient` answers a citation with bytes and offers no URL to point
 * an element at. The client's own comment says why: the bearer token is in a header on every
 * call and an `<img src>` request would not carry it, so the only ways to make a plain URL work
 * are to put the token in the query string or to move authentication into a cookie. The first
 * puts somebody's photograph library behind a value that ends up in a proxy log. The second is a
 * session mechanism this API does not have. So the bytes are fetched with the header and wrapped
 * in a blob URL.
 *
 * **The cache is keyed by the handle and bounded.** A blob URL holds its bytes alive until it is
 * revoked, so an unbounded cache over a photograph library is a memory leak measured in
 * megabytes per citation. Least-recently-opened is evicted and revoked, and `dispose` revokes
 * everything, because a blob URL that outlives the view holding it is a copy of a photograph in
 * a place the deletion path cannot reach.
 *
 * **A failure is reported, never substituted.** A citation that cannot be resolved renders as a
 * stated failure. A placeholder image in its place would be a claim that the evidence exists and
 * looks like that.
