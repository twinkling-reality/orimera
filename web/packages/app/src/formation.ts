/**
 * Watching an intake form, in the surface that has a credential and something to watch.
 *
 * **Why here and not on the landing page.** The formation stream is per intake batch and every
 * request to it carries a bearer token. A signed-out visitor has neither: no batch of their own
 * and no credential. The public landing page therefore shows no formation state. This is the
 * surface where an upload is a real thing that happened, so this is where its stream belongs.
 *
 * **Nothing here decides what a stage means.** The contract, the reducer, the labels and the
 * visual mapping all live in `@orimera/formation`, which knows nothing about this application.
 * This module chooses which batch to watch and hands the events on.
 *
 * **The batch is found, not assumed.** There is no upload endpoint yet, so an intake starts from
 * the command line and this asks the API what there is to watch. That is a smaller lie than a
 * hard-coded id and a smaller one than a fabricated batch: the list is what the workspace
 * actually contains, and an empty list renders as "nothing is forming" rather than as a spinner.
