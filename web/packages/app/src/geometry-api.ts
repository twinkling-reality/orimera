/**
 * Authenticated, digest-verified reconstruction geometry for the renderer.
 *
 * This is the production half of ADR-0009 D10. Until it existed, "no route serves artifact bytes,
 * and the only loader in the workspace is a development preview, while the app's own comment
 * claiming that production reads point maps from an API describes an implementation that does not
 * exist". The comment in `atlas.ts` is now true, and this file is what makes it true.
 *
 * The record names three requirements and each one is a line of code here.
 *
 * **Bytes in hand.** Not a URL handed to the renderer, and not a blob URL either. A point map is
 * decoded from an `ArrayBuffer` this module fetched and checked; nothing downstream is given a
 * string it could load something else from.
 *
 * **A bearer in the header.** Through the same `Transport` every other authenticated read uses,
 * which holds the token in a private field and puts it in an `authorization` header. There is no
 * variant of this that works with a plain URL: the token would have to go in a query string,
 * where it lands in a proxy log holding the keys to somebody's photograph library.
 *
 * **The content hash verified against the descriptor that named it.** The list route says what
 * each artifact's SHA-256 is; the byte route returns the bytes. The digest is computed here and
 * compared **against the descriptor**, never against the response's own `ETag`, which would be
 * checking the response against itself. A mismatch means the region gets no geometry and the
 * failure is reported: bytes that failed their check never reach `decodeOpm`.
 *
 * **Without `crypto.subtle` there is no geometry at all.** A page served over a non-secure
 * context has no `SubtleCrypto`, so the third requirement cannot be met, so the loader refuses
 * every region and says why once. Decoding unverified bytes because the environment made checking
 * inconvenient would be the exact trade this design exists to refuse.
 *
 * **A validated scene loads every placed member.** The graph record binds each point map to the
 * pose and placement receipt that puts it in a shared frame, so those maps may be drawn together.
 * The older descriptor-list method remains for single-photograph regions with no scene record and
 * still attempts one unposed map per region.

   * for ever, and because `mount()` waits for this the page would stay blank with no error, no
   * notice and no retry. Each request therefore carries its own `AbortSignal.timeout`, so a
   * stall costs one region rather than the world, and any signal the caller supplied is honoured
   * alongside it.
   *
   * **At most one attempt per region.** The region is marked before the fetch, not after the
   * decode. Marking it after would mean a region whose first reconstruction fails its digest
   * falls through to the next candidate and the next: measured on the shape this corpus has, a
   * region of sixteen photographs behind a mangling proxy would fetch fifty-four megabytes to
   * draw nothing. One attempt makes the byte cost of a load at most one point map per region,
   * whatever goes wrong.
   *
   * **A map already decoded is not fetched again.** `held` is the previous session's maps by
   * artifact id. The list itself is re-read on every mount, which is what makes a deletion
   * reach the renderer: a region whose descriptor has gone loses its geometry on the next
   * mount rather than keeping it for the life of the tab. Re-reading a few hundred bytes of
   * JSON is what that costs.
   *
   * Sequential rather than concurrent, and **`mount()` awaits the whole of it**, which is the
   * shape `SourceMediaClient.load` already has. The consequence is stated rather than left to be
   * discovered: the world's first paint waits for every region's bytes. Sequential keeps peak
   * memory at one point map and keeps a slow link from carrying five requests at once; it does
   * not shorten the wait. What would shorten it is drawing the world first and re-mounting when
   * geometry arrives, which is a change to `mount()` rather than to the fetch order, and it is
   * left undone rather than done unmeasured.
