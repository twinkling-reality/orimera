/**
 * Boot: one session, one snapshot, one scene, and one write path.
 *
 * The shape of this file is the argument. It builds a session, reads the graph once, adapts it
 * into a scene, mounts the renderer, and wires three surfaces to that one snapshot. In a normal
 * build there is no second source of truth and no fixture: everything on the screen came from
 * `GET /graph`, `GET /evidence/{span}` or a write that went through the gate. The Vite development
 * server has one explicit `?preview=1` exception for UI work while the API is unavailable. It is
 * synthetic, identified in the document title and contextual surfaces, and read-only; production
 * builds cannot enter it.
 *
 * **Every write goes through the confirmation surface**, and the confirmation surface is the only
 * caller of `session.commit`. The chain is: the user types a name, a draft is built by
 * `world-index`, translated into an update proposal, staged on the gate, rendered for reading,
 * and committed only when the user presses confirm. Skipping any link is not possible from here,
 * because `session` exposes `stage` and `commit` separately and the panel is what sits between.
 *
 * **The snapshot is re-read after a write rather than patched.** A local patch would be a second
 * model of the graph maintained by hand, and the first time it disagreed with the server the
 * interface would be confidently wrong. Re-reading costs one request and cannot drift.

 * The server ships capture ids and no island id, because ADR-0005 leaves what an island is to
 * the client; `regionsByCapture` puts them through the islands this snapshot already resolved,
 * so a shell lands in the region its own anchors did.
 *
 * **It runs on every mount, and that is what makes a deletion reach the renderer.** Called once
 * at start-up it would not: `mount()` re-reads the same decoded maps after every committed
 * write, so a photograph deleted in this session would keep its reconstruction on screen at full
 * fidelity for the life of the tab, and the 410 the delivery route so carefully produces would be
 * observable only during boot. The list is re-read each time and the bytes are not: a map already
 * decoded is handed back through `byArtifact`, so the recurring cost is a few hundred bytes of
 * JSON and the recurring benefit is that a region whose descriptor has gone loses its geometry.
 *
 * **A failure here is never a failure of the world.** A region with no geometry is rung 4, which
 * is a real rung with a real experience, and the whole thesis is that reconstruction quality
 * never participates in the truth guarantee. So every failure becomes a notice on the status bar
 * and the Atlas mounts either way, exactly as the development preview already behaves when a
 * fixture is missing. What previously could still take the world down was a request that never
 * settled; every one of them now carries a deadline.
