/**
 * Graph data becomes an `AtlasScene`. This is the adapter the boundary exists for.
 *
 * `atlas-core` imports no other workspace package, including `graph-client`, so somebody has to
 * do this conversion and it is the caller. Doing it here rather than inside either package is
 * what keeps the scene graph testable with no transport and keeps a renderer switch to two
 * packages (`.dependency-cruiser.cjs`, `atlas-core-is-self-contained`).
 *
 * Three decisions in this file are epistemic rather than graphical, and each is the honest read
 * of what the system currently knows.
 *
 * **The rung is the one the pipeline recorded, and it is displayed rather than hidden.**
 * `product-specification.md` 5.1: "the reconstruction rung a scene earned is displayed, not
 * hidden. The ladder is the honesty feature." A region the pipeline has not reconstructed carries
 * no rung at all, and that is not the same fact as rung 4: rung 4 means reconstruction ran and
 * there was too little to place. An unreconstructed region falls back to rung 4 for the SCENE
 * GRAPH, because the scene graph has to render something and no geometry is what rung 4 is, and
 * the interface says which of the two it is from the record rather than from the scene.
 *
 * **No island is metric.** `scaleIsMetric: false` is what makes `asMetricLocal` return null, and
 * that null is what makes a spatial question refuse with a stated reason instead of estimating.
 * A layout position is not a measurement and this is where that stops being a sentence in a
 * document and becomes a flag the query path reads.
 *
 * **Anchor positions inside an island are presentation, and nothing may read them as
 * measurement.** Without reconstruction there is no recovered position for a detection, so the
 * anchors are seeded on a deterministic phyllotaxis disc: the same graph produces the same
 * arrangement on every machine and on every run, and no arrangement claims anything. That is the
 * same rule the standing caption states to the user in words, and `scaleIsMetric: false` is what
 * enforces it in code.
