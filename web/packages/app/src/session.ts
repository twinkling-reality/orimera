/**
 * THE COMPOSITION ROOT, and the only file in this package permitted to name the mutation gate.
 *
 * `architecture-overview.md` 1.1: "graph-client is the only module permitted to mutate, and it
 * rejects any mutation whose proposal id is not in the pending proposal set. This is a runtime
 * check, not a lint rule."
 *
 * A composition root has to construct that gate, which means one file here has to import
 * `@orimera/graph-client/mutations`. `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` names THIS FILE rather than this
 * package, so the rule stays as strong as it was: every other module in the app receives a
 * `commit` function and cannot reach the gate to go around it. If a second file in this package
 * ever imports the mutation entry point, the boundary check fails.
 *
 * **Nothing here decides whether a proposal is sound.** The gate refuses a proposal that is not
 * pending, one that expired against the current state version, and any tier 3 operation, and it
 * refuses them at the moment of the write. This file wires it up and hands out one function.
 *
 * **The token is never in a URL.** It is held by the transport and nowhere else, which is why
 * evidence is fetched as bytes and turned into a blob URL rather than being pointed at with an
 * `<img src>`: an `<img>` request would not carry the header, and moving the token into the
 * query string to fix that would put somebody's photograph library behind a value that ends up
 * in a proxy log.
