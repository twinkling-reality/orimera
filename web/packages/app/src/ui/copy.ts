/**
 * The words. This is the only file in the workspace that authors user-facing prose.
 *
 * `atlas-core`, `companion-runtime` and `world-index` all emit message KEYS and refuse to write
 * sentences, and their docstrings say why: `companion-runtime`'s phrasing seam hands a model
 * keys and no consequences, and `atlas-core`'s rung labels record that the exact copy is OPEN in
 * `product-specification.md` P-2 while the constraint is fixed. Keeping the copy out of those
 * packages is what lets a wording change be a wording change rather than a behaviour change.
 *
 * The consequence is that somebody has to own the table, and it is this file.
 *
 * **An unmapped key renders as the key, visibly.** Not as a blank, and not as a plausible
 * fallback sentence generated from the key's own words. A blank hides a missing string, and a
 * generated sentence is prose nobody reviewed appearing in a product whose whole claim is that
 * its sentences are backed. A key on the screen is ugly and findable, which is the correct
 * trade.
 *
 * **One rule constrains the wording rather than taste.** `product-specification.md` 5.2: no
 * label may imply free movement in a region that does not have it, and no copy anywhere may say
 * private, on-device, encrypted, immutable, WORM, tamper-proof or regulatory-compliant. The rung
 * strings below are written against that and `copyIsHonest` asserts it in a test rather than
 * leaving it to review.
