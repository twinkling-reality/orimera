/**
 * A three-function DOM helper.

 * `landing` has one of these and this package may not import it: the boundary contract keeps the
 * signed-out surface free of everything this package depends on, and inverting that to share
 * twenty lines would put a renderer in the landing page's dependency graph. Duplicating a helper
 * with no rules in it is the cheaper of the two, and it is recorded here so the duplication is a
 * decision rather than an oversight.
