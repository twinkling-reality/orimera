/**
 * The forming panel: what is happening to an upload, in words that are true.
 *
 * interaction-model.md 8.1: "Every visual formation state is paired with a factual label naming
 * the real pipeline stage and the real unit of progress. There is no synthetic progress bar and
 * no invented percentage."
 *
 * **This file renders a label and does not compose one.** `formationLabel` in
 * `@orimera/formation` already decides the stage name, the one factual sentence, the supporting
 * facts, whether elapsed time belongs on screen at all, and what to say when contact was lost.
 * An earlier version of this panel worked those out again from the raw state, which is two places
 * for the same rules to drift and one of them untested. Everything below writes out what the
 * label carries, in the order it carries it.
 *
 * **There is no bar and no percentage.** The label's supporting facts already print the pair the
 * pipeline counted. Turning that into a percentage would be turning a count into a fraction of a
 * total that is often unknown, which is the exact invention section 8.1 rules out.
