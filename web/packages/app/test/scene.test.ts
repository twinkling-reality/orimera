/**
 * The adapter from graph data to the scene graph, which is where three product rules stop being
 * sentences in a document and become properties of an object.
 *
 * The one that matters most is the third: a person anchor must render as a presence marker and
 * never as world geometry. `rendersAsPresenceMarker` is a predicate in atlas-core precisely so it
 * cannot be set false by mistake, but it reads the anchor's KIND, and the kind is set here. An
 * adapter that mapped every occurrence to `object` would produce anchors for which the predicate
 * correctly returns false, and a person would be baked into a reconstruction with every guard in
 * the system reporting green.
