/**
 * The focus solver. One solver, at most one target.
 *
 * RETICLE-BASED, AND THAT IS FORCED. The Pointer Lock 2.0 specification states that while
 * locked, clientX/clientY and screenX/screenY "must hold constant values as if the pointer did
 * not move at all once pointer lock was entered". There is therefore no cursor position to hover
 * with, and all world targeting is at fixed screen centre.
 * https://w3c.github.io/pointerlock/ (interaction-model.md 2.1, VERIFIED)
 *
 * The consequence for this file: the only direction it ever reads is the camera forward vector.
 * There is no screen-space input of any kind in the signature, and there must never be one.
 *
 * interaction-model.md 3.3 fixes the scoring: "scoring candidates within an interact radius and
 * an aim cone by a weighted sum of aim (0.60), distance (0.25) and importance (0.15)".
