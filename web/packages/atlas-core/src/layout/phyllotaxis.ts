 * interaction-model.md 1.4: "A deterministic seed (phyllotaxis) plus a pinned force relaxation,
 * ordered by creation time, run once and persisted with a layout version."
 *
 * Phyllotaxis rather than a random or circular seed for three reasons: it is a closed form so
 * there is no PRNG to seed and no seeded PRNG to depend on across library versions; it produces
 * no two islands at the same radius, so the relaxation never starts from a symmetric
 * configuration it cannot break; and appending an island appends a point without moving the
 * earlier ones, which is exactly the incremental behaviour the drift clamp wants.
