/**
 * The layout solver.
 *
 * interaction-model.md 1.4, and every sentence of it is load-bearing:
 *
 *   - "Layout is a stored artifact, never recomputed at runtime." This function runs on ingest
 *     and its output is persisted with a layout version. It is not called from a frame loop and
 *     nothing in atlas-core calls it.
 *   - "A deterministic seed (phyllotaxis) plus a pinned force relaxation, ordered by creation
 *     time." No PRNG appears anywhere in this file, and no `Date.now()`. Same input, byte-
 *     identical output, on any machine.
 *   - "Pre-existing regions are pinned during relaxation and then hard clamped inside a small
 *     drift radius, so adding a fourth capture cannot scramble the user's spatial memory of the
 *     first three."
 *   - "Speculative links must never move the world." Enforced upstream in `layoutEntitiesOf`.
 *
 * SCOPE. This solves 1 to 5 islands and refuses more. The brief says three to five; the product
 * says most users upload one or two photographs, and one photograph is one island, so the low
 * end has to work. Refusing at six is deliberate: "Do not solve infinite worlds." A force layout
 * whose behaviour was never examined above five islands should fail loudly rather than produce
 * a plausible-looking arrangement nobody has checked.
