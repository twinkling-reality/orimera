/**
 * Reading the `.opm` container that `@orimera/scene-synth` and `orimera.reconstruction` write.
 *
 * The boundary contract forbids this package from importing scene-synth, so the container is
 * re-described here from its documented layout rather than shared as a type. That duplication is
 * deliberate and it is the point: the bake-off has to prove that a renderer binding can load the
 * bytes with no build-time coupling to the tool that produced them.
 *
 * THE ONE REQUIREMENT: no per-point JavaScript. Parsing cost must not land inside a number that
 * is supposed to be about rendering. Everything below is a header parse plus one typed-array
 * view per section over the same ArrayBuffer.
 *
 * **This reads OPM/2 and refuses OPM/1 by name.** ADR-0010 D9 is refuse and regenerate: there is
 * no upgrade on read, and this reader is the one the app's loader hands bytes to, so the message
 * has to say what produces the new version rather than only that the old one is unsupported.
 *
 * **The section list is authoritative, and that is the whole of ADR-0010 D2.** Every offset and
 * every stride below comes from the header. Under OPM/1 three sections were hardcoded here and
 * the packed stride was the literal 18 in the binding, so the header's own generic section list
 * was a fiction; the registry is what makes "a registered optional section is not a version
 * bump" true, because a reader that has never heard of a section still reads the ones it knows.
