/**
 * One island's 2.5D shell as a PlayCanvas mesh.
 *
 * ENGINE CONSTRAINT WORTH RECORDING. A PlayCanvas `Mesh` owns exactly one `VertexBuffer`. There is
 * no equivalent of three.js's independent `BufferAttribute` per channel, and the only second
 * stream a mesh can carry is the hardware-instancing one. So a planar (structure-of-arrays) point
 * map has to arrive as a single contiguous run of position, then colour, then segment, in that
 * order and with no padding between them, or it has to be repacked on the CPU.
 *
 * `.opm` happens to satisfy that for every count in the bake-off ladder, so the fast path is a
 * zero-copy `Uint8Array` view of the fetched file. `packedVertexBytes` reports when it is not
 * satisfied and a copy was made, because a per-point CPU pass inside a render benchmark is
 * exactly the kind of thing that should never be silent.
 *
 * **THE WEBGPU REPACK IS GONE, AND THE CONTAINER IS WHY.** This binding used to widen the
 * segment channel from one uint16 to two on the CPU, for every point of every cloud, on WebGPU
 * only: a planar uint16 channel is a vertex stream with `arrayStride` 2, WebGL2 accepts it,
 * PlayCanvas's debug build only warns, and WebGPU rejects the pipeline outright and silently in
 * a release build. The note left here said "the right long-term fix is for the container to
 * store `segment` as 4 bytes". ADR-0010 D3 did that. Both graphics paths now upload the same
 * zero-copy view of the file, and the two shader sources read the same two channels.
