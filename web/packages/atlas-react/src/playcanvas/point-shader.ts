/**
 * The point-map shader, in GLSL for WebGL2 and WGSL for WebGPU.
 *
 * WHY BOTH SOURCES EXIST, which is a finding rather than a style choice. PlayCanvas can transpile
 * a custom GLSL shader to WGSL at runtime, but only if the application supplies `glslangUrl` and
 * `twgslUrl` when creating the device. Those two WASM transpilers are NOT shipped inside the
 * `playcanvas` npm package (verified against 2.21.4: no glslang or twgsl artifact anywhere in the
 * tarball). So a custom shader on the WebGPU path means either two hand-written sources or two
 * extra network fetches of third-party WASM inside the measurement. This file takes the first
 * option, which is also the only one that keeps the bake-off numbers clean.
 *
 * A SECOND FINDING LIVES IN THE WGSL. WGSL has no point-size output. The GLSL path writes
 * `gl_PointSize` and gets perspective-correct point sprites; the WebGPU `point-list` topology
 * draws every point as exactly one pixel and there is no way to ask for more. PlayCanvas's own
 * engine acknowledges this by writing `gl_PointSize = 1.0` in its only reference to point size.
 * The consequence for Orimera is direct: the WebGPU path cannot render a point map that looks
 * like a surface, only one that looks like static, unless the geometry is rebuilt as expanded
 * quads at six vertices per point. See the harness notes.
 *
 * Everything the shader branches on is REAL SEMANTIC STATE, uploaded from `semantics.ts`, which
 * derives it from `readsAsUnconfirmed` in atlas-core. There is no "look mysterious" constant.
