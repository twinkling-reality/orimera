/**
 * What a region looks like from above.
 *
 * The Atlas Map has always been the right camera and an empty picture. It is the same scene at a
 * 55 degree vantage, exactly as `interaction-model.md` 6.2 specifies, but a region had no vertical
 * form, so an oblique view of four flat placements showed a flat plane with four labels on it. The
 * angle was never the problem; there was nothing up there to see.
 *
 * The obvious fix is a plinth or a platform under each region, and `atlas-visual-language.md` 4
 * rejects exactly that, correctly: a disc under a memory is scenery, it asserts an edge the data
 * does not have, and it makes the Map a diagram of the renderer rather than of the person's life.
 *
 * So the mass is not a container for the evidence. **It is the evidence.** One standing mark per
 * anchor, at the anchor's own position, converted through the single legal local-to-atlas
 * conversion. A region holding three detections is three marks; one holding two hundred is a
 * dense block you can read from altitude. Height carries link state and colour carries provenance,
 * which are the two things the semantic dictionary already says those channels mean, so nothing
 * here is decoration standing in for knowledge. The count is the shape.
 *
 * It exists only at the Map vantage. From the ground the same anchors are already the entity
 * glyphs and the source apertures, and a second standing copy of them would be the duplicate
 * readable body that composition rule 2 forbids.

 * second. It was a single pixel: the geometry was correct, in the frustum, in the right layer and
 * facing the camera, and invisible, which is the most expensive kind of correct. Sizing from the
