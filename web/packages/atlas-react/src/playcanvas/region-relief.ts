/**
 * What a region looks like from above when something actually reconstructed it.
 *
 * `region-mass.ts` answers the same question for a region with no geometry: one standing mark per
 * anchor, because the count is the only shape such a region has. This module is the other half of
 * that answer. A region holding a point map has a real surface with a real height and a real
 * colour, and drawing it as a cluster of abstract blocks throws away the one thing it has that
 * the others do not.
 *
 * **This is not the plinth `atlas-visual-language.md` 4 rejects, and the difference is the whole
 * justification.** That section removes "plinth discs" and "terrain platforms" from the origin
 * profile, and it is right to: a disc under a memory asserts an edge the data does not have. The
 * same section defines a semantic object as one deriving from "graph, evidence, navigation, or
 * RECONSTRUCTION state". A height sampled out of a point map is reconstruction state. It is not a
 * platform placed under the evidence to make it look founded; it IS the evidence, seen from
 * above, at the one vantage where its vertical form is the readable content.
 *
 * **A cell with nothing in it is a hole, not a zero, and most cells are holes.** Measured on the
 * courtyard, a single-view shell covers between eleven and twenty-seven per cent of its own
 * bounding box seen from above, at every grid resolution tried. That is not a defect in the
 * sampling: a 2.5D reconstruction is a CURTAIN. Its surfaces are mostly vertical, and a wall has
 * almost no area from overhead however well it was photographed. So this draws a tile per
 * observed cell rather than a stitched terrain, which shows all of what was seen and bridges
 * none of what was not. A region will read as a ribbon until it has been reconstructed from more
 * than one viewpoint, and a ribbon is the honest shape of one photograph seen from above.
 *
 * **The sky is excluded, and by measurement rather than by a height cut.** A monocular model
 * places the background tens of metres out where adjacent samples land metres apart, and those
 * points would otherwise form a vast flat plateau behind every region. They are dropped on the
 * support channel, which already says how coarsely each point was sampled, so what survives is
 * surface the photograph resolved rather than surface a height threshold happened to spare.
 *
 * The consequence is a Map that is deliberately mixed: reconstructed regions carry relief and
 * unreconstructed ones carry anchor marks. That is the rung ladder showing through, which is what
 * `product-specification.md` 5.1 asks the interface to do rather than hide.
