/**
 * The real event source: server-sent events from the provenance ledger, over HTTP.
 *
 * **It is a `fetch` reader and not an `EventSource`, and that is forced rather than chosen.**
 * `source.ts` used to describe the implementation as a browser `EventSource` over a url, and
 * that cannot work here: `EventSource` sends no custom headers, so it cannot carry a bearer
 * token, and the only ways to make it authenticate are to put the credential in the query string
 * or to move authentication into a cookie. The first puts the key to somebody's photograph
 * library into every proxy log between here and the server, and `graph-client`'s transport says
 * so in as many words. The second is a session mechanism this API does not have.
 *
 * What is lost by not using `EventSource` is its automatic reconnect, and that turns out to be
 * worth losing: this holds the resume token itself, so a reconnect resumes from the last event
 * the REDUCER saw rather than from the last frame the browser happened to receive.
 *
 * **A dropped stream is reported as lost, not as a finished pipeline.** `StreamState` exists
 * because "the pipeline stopped" and "we stopped hearing about it" are different facts, and only
 * one of them is about the photographs. The reducer freezes on `lost` and nothing advances,
 * which is the behaviour interaction-model.md 8.4 asks for and which falls out of there being no
 * timer anywhere in this module.
 *
 * **Nothing here parses a phase or invents a number.** A frame is JSON, it is handed to the
 * reducer, and a frame that is not usable is dropped with the stream marked lost rather than
 * repaired. `assertUsableEvent` throws on a negative count or a non-finite timestamp precisely so
 * that a pipeline bug surfaces instead of being rendered as a plausible display.
