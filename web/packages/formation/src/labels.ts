/**
 * The honest label for every formation state.
 *
 * interaction-model.md 8.1 and 8.3. Two rules shape every sentence below:
 *
 *   - The label names the real pipeline stage and the real unit of progress. No percentages, no
 *     estimated time remaining, no "almost done".
 *   - The label always states what is already usable, not only what is pending.
 *
 * And one rule shapes the file rather than the sentences: **the label set is byte-identical under
 * reduced motion** (8.3, and the table in section 9). Nothing here takes a motion preference,
 * which is the cheapest possible way to guarantee that no information lives only in an animation.
