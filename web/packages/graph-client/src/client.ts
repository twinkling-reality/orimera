/**
 * The routes. Which requests the product makes, and what each answer becomes.
 *
 * Two routes: `GET /graph`, which is the whole world at one state version, and
 * `GET /evidence/{handle}`, which is the original bytes a citation resolves to. That is the
 * entire read surface, and it is short enough to check against the API by eye.
 *
 * The work each answer needs is elsewhere and this file only names it: `wire.ts` says what the
 * server sent, `snapshot.ts` turns that into the read model and records every gap, `islands.ts`
 * says what an island is. The read model did not have to change to make the transport real, which
 * is what the boundary was for.
