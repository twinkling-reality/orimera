/**
 * @orimera/graph-client
 *
 * Entity graph reads, the assertion log and evidence resolution. This package sits UNDER
 * everything: it may not import atlas-core, atlas-react, companion-runtime or world-index
 * (architecture-overview.md 1.1), and `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` enforces that.
 *
 * Mutations live behind a second entry point, `@orimera/graph-client/mutations`, so that
 * "atlas-react forbids graph mutations" is a path a lint rule can name rather than a habit.
 *
 * The transport is real, and four files divide the work of speaking to it. `wire.ts` says what
 * the server sent, in the server's own words. `snapshot.ts` turns that into the read model and is
 * the single place where the difference between what the read model asks for and what the server
 * can answer is written down. `islands.ts` says what an island is, which is the client's decision
 * and not the server's. `client.ts` says which routes exist. The read model did not have to
 * change to make the transport real, which is what the boundary was for.
 *
 * What this file names is the package's vocabulary, not its contents. It is a curated list rather
 * than four `export *` lines because of what it leaves out: the thirteen helpers those files are
 * built from stay inside the package. How a confidence band is derived from a modality count is a
 * decision inside one file, and putting it in the workspace namespace would invite a second
 * caller and turn it into a shared rule nobody owns. The exports map exposes only `.` and
 * `./mutations`, so a deep import of one of those files does not resolve at all.
