/**
 * What an island is, who decides it, and what an island may honestly carry.
 *
 * **An island is decided here, not on the server.** ADR-0005 records that whether an island is
 * one capture or a place-on-a-trip cluster is OPEN "until the real distribution of the corpus has
 * been measured", so the server returns capture ids and a grouping, and this maps them through an
 * injectable function.
 *
 * THE CORPUS HAS NOW BEEN MEASURED, so the default has changed. 80 photographs across five visits
 * to three places cluster into five scene groups of sixteen. One island per capture would be 80
 * islands, and `solveLayout` refuses more than five and says why: "a force layout whose behaviour
 * was never examined above five islands should fail loudly rather than produce a plausible-looking
 * arrangement nobody has checked". One island per scene group is five. The default is therefore
 * the group, falling back to the capture for anything the grouping did not place, which is the
 * honest answer for a photograph with no usable clock.
 *
 * The function is still injectable and the server still ships no island id, so this remains one
 * argument to have rather than a server change, which is exactly what it was kept for.
