/**
 * The entity graph READ model.
 *
 * architecture-overview.md 1.1 gives graph-client "entity graph reads and writes, assertion log,
 * evidence resolution". This file is the reads and the assertion log, as the shape the two
 * consumers actually need: companion-runtime builds its option pool from it, world-index renders
 * it. Both of those packages may import graph-client; graph-client may import neither.
 *
 * WHY THESE ENUMS ARE DUPLICATED FROM atlas-core. `ProvenanceClass`, `LinkState` and
 * `ConfidenceBand` also exist in atlas-core/provenance.ts over the same closed sets. That is not
 * an oversight and it must not be "fixed" by importing: graph-client sits UNDER atlas-core
 * (`graph-client-is-the-base` in .dependency-cruiser.cjs), so the arrow can only point the other
 * way, and atlas-core is deliberately self-contained. Both spellings are transcriptions of the
 * same SQL enums in domain-and-evidence-model.md 2.1 and 4.3, which is the single source.
 *
 * WHY IDS ARE PLAIN STRINGS HERE. atlas-core brands its ids. Branding them a second time in this
 * package would create two incompatible nominal types over one value and force a cast at every
 * call site in world-index. A plain alias accepts an atlas-core branded id unchanged, so the
 * seam costs nothing in the direction data actually flows (graph -> presentation).
