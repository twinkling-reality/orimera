/**
 * Server payload to read model, with every gap stated.
 *
 * Four of the fields the read model asks for and the server cannot answer today: the four whose
 * reason needs more than a line. The others carry theirs at the line that sets them. Each is set
 * to the value that is TRUE rather than the value that looks complete:
 *
 *   - `confidence`: null on every entity and 'low' on every occurrence link. A confirmed link is
 *     a human decision and has no confidence, it has support, which is exactly what the read
 *     model's own comment says. A match proposal DOES carry a band now, and it is a count rather
 *     than a score: how many independent signals agree. A band derived from an uncalibrated
 *     weighted sum would be a guess wearing a band's clothes, and no calibration data exists.
 *   - `citingAnswerCount`: 0, and it means 'no answer is stored anywhere', not "no answer cites
 *     this". The field exists because a tier 3 confirmation must state how many answers lose
 *     their citation. Until answers are stored, a tier 3 confirmation cannot state it, and the
 *     gate refuses tier 3 anyway.
 *   - `anchorIds` on a proposal: the occurrence's own id is used as its anchor. An anchor is a
 *     placed object in the Atlas and the placement is the client's, so this is the identity map
 *     until a layout exists to ask.
 *   - `status`: derived from what the server knows, and the mapping is exact rather than
 *     approximate. A name is only ever written by an active `kind='user'` assertion, so an
 *     entity with one is `user_asserted`. An entity with `merged_into` set is `merged_away`.
 *     Everything else is `inferred_only`: it exists because a detector saw something and no
 *     person has spoken about it. `needs_review` outranks both and means one thing: a proposal
 *     about this entity is pending, from `pending_match_proposal` on the server, which is a
 *     question the user has not answered rather than one that was ever asked. It is the review
 *     queue's only filter, so an entity is in the queue exactly when a question about it is
 *     waiting. It loses to `merged_away`, because an alias redirect is not something to review,
 *     and it beats `user_asserted`, because a named person with an open question is precisely
 *     what the queue is for; the provenance triad still shows that a person has spoken.
