/**
 * The HTTP transport. One place that knows the API exists, and one place that knows what a
 * failure means.
 *
 * Everything else in this package works on the read model, which is why this file is small and
 * why it is separate: `companion-runtime` and `world-index` build against types, not against
 * fetch, and a test of either needs no server.
 *
 * Three properties worth naming, because each is a decision rather than a default.
 *
 * **A failure carries its code, not its status.** The API answers every failure with
 * `{code, detail}`, and the code is the thing worth branching on: `unknown_reference` means the
 * same thing whether it arrived as a 404 from the evidence route or from an identity commit.
 * Callers that switch on a number end up encoding the router.
 *
 * **404 is not an error class of its own.** The API returns 404 for 'not there' and for "not
 * yours", deliberately and identically, so that the surface is not an existence oracle. A client
 * that distinguished them would be reconstructing the oracle the server refuses to be.
 *
 * **The bearer token is held here and nowhere else.** It is not on the read model, not on a
 * snapshot and not in a URL. A token in a query string ends up in a proxy log, and the corpus it
 * unlocks is somebody's photographs.
