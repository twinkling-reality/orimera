/**
 * What the API sends, in the API's own words.
 *
 * Snake case, ISO 8601 strings, ids that are plain strings. These are the server's shapes and
 * they are deliberately not the read model's: a reader checking this file against the route that
 * produces it is comparing like with like, and `snapshot.ts` is then the single place where the
 * two vocabularies meet and every difference between them has to be written down.
 *
 * `toMs` lives here because reading one of these timestamps is a wire concern. The server sends a
 * string and every caller wants epoch milliseconds. A string that will not parse becomes null
 * rather than NaN, because NaN travels silently through arithmetic and comes out the far end as a
 * date, whereas a null has to be handled by whoever received it.
