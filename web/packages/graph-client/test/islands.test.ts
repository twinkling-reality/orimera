 * ADR-0005's open question, now answered by measurement rather than left open.
 *
 * The corpus is 80 photographs across five visits, which cluster into five scene groups. One
 * island per capture is 80 islands and `solveLayout` refuses more than five. One island per
 * group is five. These tests pin the default that follows, and pin that it is still only a
 * default: the whole point of keeping the function injectable was that this stays an argument.
