 * mouse-look, mouse-look is built on the Pointer Lock API, and interaction-model.md 2.1 records
 * the verified platform fact that pointer lock is unsupported on iOS Safari and Android Chrome:
 * "a hard platform limit with no workaround, not a scoping choice, and it is not solvable by
 * effort." product-specification.md 7 defers mobile Atlas traversal for exactly that reason.
 *
 * So the boundary states the real cause rather than "unsupported browser". A visitor who is told
 * why can decide what to do about it; a visitor who is told their device is wrong cannot.
 *
 * The predicate is separated from the DOM so it can be tested without a browser, which is the
 * only way the thresholds stay honest as the layout changes.
