/**
 * THE INTERCHANGE FORMAT, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE.
 *
 * `.opm` (Orimera Point Map): a binary container holding a JSON header followed by planar
 * typed-array sections, the first of them 16-byte aligned. One file, one fetch, zero parsing.
 *
 * The requirement is narrow and it is not "a good point cloud format". It is: BOTH RENDERER
 * BINDINGS IN ADR-0003 MUST LOAD THE SAME BYTES AT THE SAME COST. The bake-off measures render
 * performance. Any format whose decode cost differs between three.js and PlayCanvas puts loader
 * engineering into a number that is supposed to be about rendering, and the ADR would then be
 * decided partly by whose parser is better, which is not the question.
 *
 * What that buys, concretely: `fetch` -> `arrayBuffer()` -> three `subarray` views ->
 * `new THREE.BufferAttribute(view, n)` or `new pc.VertexBuffer(device, format, count, {data:
 * view})`. Neither engine touches a point individually on the CPU.
 *
 * ONLY THE FIRST SECTION IS ALIGNED, AND THAT IS A CORRECTION. This writer used to align every
 * section to 16 bytes, which ADR-0010 supersedes by name: PlayCanvas computes its own tightly
 * packed planar offsets, so a gap anywhere costs a per-point CPU repack, and the gap appeared for
 * every point count that was not a multiple of four. The production validator refused these files
 * outright. Aligning the start and packing the rest behind it keeps every typed-array view legal,
 * because the strides that follow are all multiples of the element sizes behind them.
 *
 * REJECTED, with reasons:
 *
 *   PLY (binary or ASCII). The obvious choice and the wrong one here. Both engines can read it,
 *   but through different loaders with different per-point JavaScript parses, and custom
 *   properties (segment id, confidence) are exactly where those loaders diverge most. It is kept
 *   as an OPTIONAL SIDE OUTPUT for eyeballing in MeshLab or SuperSplat, because being able to
 *   look at the fixture matters and PLY is what the tools read.
 *
 *   SOG (meta.json plus lossless WebP). ADR-0003 fixes SOG as the delivery format and it is the
 *   right choice THERE, but SOG describes GAUSSIAN SPLATS: position, scale, rotation, opacity,
 *   spherical harmonics. This generator produces a POINT MAP, which is rung 3 on the
 *   reconstruction ladder and explicitly not splats (product-specification.md section 5).
 *   Encoding points as degenerate splats would misrepresent the rung and would tilt the bake-off
 *   toward whichever engine has the better splat path, when the point of measuring rung 3 is
 *   that it is the guaranteed floor with no gate that can fail. When experiment X-1 produces a
 *   real splat, the bake-off should load real SOG alongside this.
 *
 *   glTF / GLB with a POINTS primitive. Standard, and genuinely viable. Rejected because the
 *   segment id and confidence become non-standard `_SEGMENT` / `_CONFIDENCE` attributes that
 *   both loaders need custom plumbing for, and because PlayCanvas's glTF loader constructs a
 *   full entity and mesh graph on the way in. More moving parts inside the measurement, no gain.
 *   `.opm` is deliberately GLB-shaped (magic, length-prefixed JSON header, aligned binary
 *   sections) so moving to glTF later is a re-wrapping rather than a rewrite.
 *
 *   A separate `meta.json` sidecar. Rejected for the primary file: a second HTTP request adds
 *   variable latency to load timings. The header IS written out separately as `<name>.meta.json`
 *   for tooling and for humans, but the `.opm` is self-contained and the sidecar is never needed
 *   to read it.
 *
 * COST: 20 bytes per point. 5.0 MB at 250k, 80 MB at 4M. Eighteen under OPM/1, and the two extra
 * bytes are the tags section's second channel: the engine was already padding the old two-byte
 * segment attribute to four on WebGPU, per point, on the CPU. Positions are float32 rather than
 * quantised because a quantisation grid would flatten exactly the depth noise the fixture exists
 * to reproduce. If upload bandwidth ever needs to be measured separately, add a quantised
 * variant as a second section type rather than changing this one.
