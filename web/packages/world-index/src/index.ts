/**
 * @orimera/world-index
 *
 * The index UI, entity detail and the provenance panel. Forbidden: the renderer
 * (architecture-overview.md 1.1).
 *
 * That ban is what makes this package the accessibility route and the default entry on touch
 * devices: it has to work with no canvas at all. Pointer Lock is unsupported on iOS Safari and
 * Android Chrome (https://caniuse.com/pointerlock, interaction-model.md 2.1), so browser-only
 * mobile has no first-person Atlas and this is where it lands instead.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PACKAGE IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. It is the view model and the interaction rules: the
 * facets and their URL encoding, the row projection with its epistemic marks, the fixed-order
 * entity detail, the action tiers, the review-queue preset and the mobile entry decision. It is
 * not markup. No view framework is a dependency of this workspace yet, and adding one is a
 * decision for whoever writes the binding; everything here is framework-free so that decision
 * stays open and so every rule above is testable without a DOM.
 *
 * The two places this package refuses to reimplement anything:
 *   - the four-band provenance panel comes from companion-runtime (5.2 is "one component with
 *     two mount points", and this is the second mount point).
 *   - row order comes from companion-runtime's value function (6.3: the queue, the Companion and
 *     the ambient counter must agree, or "the product would feel like two systems arguing").
